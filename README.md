# WG21 SG16 Unicode study group
SG16 is an ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG21 C++ study group tasked with improving Unicode and text processing support within the C++ standard.

If you would like to contribute to the discussion, please subcribe to our mailing list at
https://lists.isocpp.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/sg16.

Meetings are generally held twice a month; invitations are sent to the mailing list.
Summaries of past meetings are available at
https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings/blob/master/README.md.

A standing paper that describes our intended scope, directives, guidelines and
constraints is available at [P1238 - SG16: Unicode Direction][P1238].
Anyone wanting to follow or contribute to SG16 should become familiar with it.

We also provide input on other proposals within WG21 and WG14 when those proposals
touch on topics listed in
[P1253 - Guidelines for when a WG21 proposal should be reviewed by SG16][P1253].

The following sections list projects, Unicode papers, and ISO papers that fall
under the purview of SG16.
