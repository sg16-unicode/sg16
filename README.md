# WG21 SG16 Unicode study group
SG16 is an ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG21 C++ study group tasked with improving Unicode and text processing support within the C++ standard.

If you would like to contribute to the discussion, please join us on [<img src="http://slack.com/favicon.ico" height="16"/>Slack](https://cpplang.slack.com/messages/sg16_unicode) at https://cpplang.slack.com/messages/sg16_unicode
(an invitation can be requested at https://cpplang.now.sh) and subcribe to our mailing list at
https://lists.isocpp.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/sg16.

Meetings are generally held twice a month; invitations are sent to the mailing list.  Summaries of past meetings are available at https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings/blob/master/README.md.

A standing paper that describes our intended scope, directives, guidelines and constraints is available at [P1238 - SG16: Unicode Direction][P1238].  Anyone wanting to follow or contribute to SG16 should become familiar with it.

The following sections list papers and projects currently under our purview.  Additionally, we provide input to proposals that originate elsewhere within WG21 when those proposals touch on topics listed in [P1253 - Guidelines for when a WG21 proposal should be reviewed by SG16][P1253].
