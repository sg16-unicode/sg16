# SG16 Operating Procedures

This document details the operating procedures that govern collaboration in SG16.  Specifically, it details
the processes used by SG16 to abide by
[SD-4: WG21 Practices and Procedures](https://isocpp.org/std/standing-documents/sd-4-wg21-practices-and-procedures).
These procedures are also intended to align with those described in
[P2145: Evolving C++ Remotely](https://wg21.link/p2145).

# Contact

For any questions or concerns regarding these procedures, please contact the SG16 chair at tom@honermann.net.

# Code of conduct

SG16 follows the WG21 code of conduct described in
[SD-4: WG21 Practices and Procedures](https://isocpp.org/std/standing-documents/sd-4-wg21-practices-and-procedures#code-of-conduct).

# Collaboration

SG16 welcomes participation from anyone with applicable C++, Unicode, and/or text processing expertise
from around the globe.  The following resources are available to accommodate such participation.

## Mailing list

The SG16 mailing list is open to the public.  Subscription information and archives are available at
https://lists.isocpp.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/sg16.  The mailing list is intended for general
organizational use, technical discussion, and dissemination of other relevant information.

## Slack

Most informal discussion occurs on Slack in the
[sg16_unicode channel within the Cpplang workspace](https://cpplang.slack.com/messages/sg16_unicode).
Participants will require an invitation to the Cpplang workspace to join the channel.  An invitation
can be requested by contacting the SG16 chair via the contact information listed above.

## Meetings

Two forms of meetings take place:
- **Telecons** are held approximately twice a month.  These are public meetings and summaries of them are
  made publicly available at https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings and in WG21 papers such as
  [P1666](https://wg21.link/p1666).  Meeting times and draft agendas are posted to the SG16 Slack channel
  and at https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings.  Invitations are sent to the mailing list and to
  prior attendees.  An invitation can be requested by contacting the SG16 chair via the contact information
  listed above.
- **Face to face** meetings are held at WG21 meetings.  Attendees must follow the normal WG21 procedures
  to attend.  Remote access may be made available for recognized experts at the SG16 chair's discretion
  pending available technical equipment.  Summaries of these meetings are **not** made public in accordance
  with WG21 procedures, but anonymized poll questions and results may be quoted in public facing documents.

# Polling and Decision Making

Consensus requires a quorum of regular attendees and acknowledged experts.  Both quorum and consensus are
determined by the chair.  The chair conducts polls.  Polls may be conducted at both telecons and face to
face meetings.

In both telecons and face to face meetings, polls are conducted via a show of (virtual) hands.  The
positions of individuals are not recorded; only the sums for each position are recorded.  Statements for
those strongly in favor or strongly opposed to a poll may be recorded in an anonymized fasion.

For various reasons, including but not limited to travel and timezone challenges, some qualified experts
will be unable to participate in either telecons or face to face meetings.  SG16 has a responsibility to
ensure that the perspectives and expertise of such experts is included in decision making.

Traditional WG21 processes were changed by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Prior to this event,
SG16 would typically conduct polls and forward recommendations to upstream subgroups at face to face
meetings.  Following the cancelation of the Varna 2020 summer meeting, it became necessary to conduct
polling at telecons so that SG16 recommendations could be forwarded to upstream subgroups for processing
at their telecons.

Polls are frequently drafted in response to active discussion.  That makes it unrealistic to prepare
polls in advance, whether for telecons or face to face meetings.  Further, it is frequently difficult to
infer the motivation or intent of a poll based solely on the poll text; discussion leading up to the poll
is often critical context.  For these reasons, participation in polls is limited to those that were
present for preceding discussion.

In order to ensure that the perspectives of those that are unable to attend telecons are taken into account,
poll results in telecons that are deemed to have consensus by telecon participants will be deemed to have
tentative consensus.  The results of such polls will be posted to the SG16 mailing list in order to invite
dissenting opinions over a one week period.  If dissent is expressed, then the chair will determine if the
level of dissent is sufficient to override the tentative consensus position obtained during the telecon
and, if so, will schedule further discussion; otherwise, the tentative consensus will become the SG16
consensus and will be communicated as a recommendation to upstream subgroups as necessary.

When the chair anticipates taking an important poll prior to a telecon, the chair will send a notification
to the SG16 mailing list in advance of the telecon with the goal of maximizing attendance.

Polling at face to face meetings will not follow a tentative consensus process due to time constraints; at
face to face meetings, it is critical that study group recommendations are communicated quickly to upstream
subgroups.  The following section details procedures that can be followed following a face to face meeting
by non-attendees with dissenting perspectives.

# Revisiting Prior Decisions

Prior SG16 decisions may be revisited, at the chair's discretion, if new information on a topic becomes
available.  However, the process of revisiting a prior decision differs depending on the actions that have
followed that decision.
- If SG16 has communicated a decision to an upstream subgroup, but that subgroup has not yet taken further
  action on that decision, then the prior decision can be revisited within SG16 via an appeal to the chair
  and presentation of new information.  The chair will then notify the upstream subgroup that the decision
  is being reconsidered.
- If SG16 has communicated a decision to an upstream subgroup, and that subgroup has taken further action on
  that decision, then revisiting the decision will require one of two approaches:
  - An appeal to the upstream subgroup chair to revisit the decision in the upstream subgroup.  The upstream
    subgroup chair will then decide to revisit the matter in the upstream subgroup or to send the
    matter back to SG16 to return with a new recommendation.
  - A new paper arguing for a new position.  Such a paper can be targeted to either SG16, the upstream
    subgroup, or both.  The respective chairs will then schedule the paper for further discussion.
