<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>
WG21 has historically used two distinct chat services.
IRC channels hosted on
<a href="https://freenode.net">freenode</a>
have long been used for coordination between rooms and meeting attendees at
face to face meetings.
In more recent times, channels on the
<a href="https://cpplang.slack.com">Cpplang</a>
Slack workspace funded by
<a href="https://cppalliance.org">The C++ Alliance</a>
have been used by WG21 work groups (WGs) and study groups (SGs) for informal
collaboration between meetings and for coordination at face to face meetings.
Neither of these services is maintained by WG21 adminstrators, nor are they
moderated in accordance with the
<a title="SD-4: WG21 Practices and Procedures"
   href="https://isocpp.org/std/standing-documents/sd-4-wg21-practices-and-procedures#code-of-conduct">
   WG21 code of conduct</a><sup><a title="SD-4: WG21 Practices and Procedures"
                                   href="#ref_wg21_coc">[WG21_COC]</a></sup>,

The possibility of a WG21 managed chat service was raised during the
<a title="WG21 Pre-Autumn 2020 telecon minutes"
   href="https://wg21.link/n4871">
   Autumn 2020 pre-meeting telecon</a><sup><a title="WG21 Pre-Autumn 2020 telecon minutes"
                                              href="#ref_wg21_n4871">[WG21_N4871]</a></sup>
and Tom Honermann was directed to submit a paper to be discussed at a future
administrative telecon.
Contained herein is a proposal to establish a WG21 sponsored and maintained
chat service governed under existing WG21 practices and procedures to be used
for informal discussion within WGs and SGs, and for coordination at face to face
meetings.
</p>


<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>

<p>
Slack has been a useful resource within SG16 for collaboration, informal sharing
of ideas and news, and discussion of controversial topics.
The author of this paper believes such use has been instrumental in creating
unity, engagement, and cohesiveness within the group.
Slack has also been used by SG15, and continues to be used by many WG21 members
for language and library design discussions of C++ features such as ranges and
concepts.
</p>

<p>
Concerns over the lack of enforcement of a code of conduct (CoC) within the
<a href="https://cpplang.slack.com">Cpplang</a>
Slack workspace has prompted several prominent SG16 attendees to deactivate
their accounts.
SG16 is now in the position of having to migrate to a new chat service in
order to restore the vibrant participation that was enjoyed previously;
discussion on the SG16 Slack channel has dropped precipitously since these
deactivations occurred.
While several options are available, a WG21 managed service that requires
compliance with the WG21 CoC is preferred.
</p>

<p>
A WG21 managed service would address the current adhoc use of both IRC and Slack
during face to face meetings thereby simplifying collaboration.
New attendees at face to face meetings that feel intimidated by the prospect of
voicing their ideas and concerns in front of a room full of experts may feel
more comfortable asking for clarification, elaboration, or confirmation of their
thoughts on a chat service before speaking up; a common chat service may help to
facilitate increased participation by new attendees.
Since both IRC and Slack are open to people that are not committee members, use
of a WG21 managed service might help to reduce the possibility of unintended
information leaks during face to face meetings.
A discussion on the committee chairs mailing list suggested that at leat two
WGs and several SGs would make use of a WG21 managed service if provided.

</p>


<h1 id="proposal">Proposal</h1>

<p>
Assuming the identification of a product that meets the requirements listed
above, the following configuration is proposed for deployment of an environment
that can be managed in accordance with the WG21 CoC.
This configuration is intended to encourage maximum participation by offering
an appropriate balance of free expression and expectations of privacy while
ensuring that CoC violations can be identified and acted on in a timely and
appropriate manner.
<ul>
  <li>Participation will require authentication with a WG21 managed
      account provisioning service such as that used for
      <a href="https://isocpp.org/papers">isocpp.org/papers</a>.</li>
  <li>Participation will be limited to WG21 members and selected outside experts
      similarly to participation in WG21 mailing lists.  Authorization of
      outside experts will follow the existing protocol used to authorize
      membership in non-public WG21 mailing lists.</li>
  <li>All channels will be administratively defined; users will not be able to
      create adhoc channels.  This is intended to ensure that each channel has
      an appropriate moderator assigned.</li>
  <li>Private channels and correspondence will not be enabled.  This is intended
      to ensure that all communications are observable for CoC purposes.
      Assuming a product that supports threaded messages like Slack, users will
      be permitted to engage in discussions that are not broadcast to all users
      within a channel, but those discussions will still be accessible to all
      members of the channel.</li>
  <li>Chat messages will be subject to the same expectations of privacy as
      statements made during a WG21 face to face meeting or telecon.  Users may
      not be quoted outside the chat service without explicit permission.</li>
  <li>Channels will be provided for each WG, SG, and advisory group (AG) subject
      to approval by the group chair and the availability of moderators as
      delegated by the chair.  A chair may serve as moderator.</li>
  <li>CoC violations will be reported as described in the
      <a title="SD-4: WG21 Practices and Procedures"
         href="https://isocpp.org/std/standing-documents/sd-4-wg21-practices-and-procedures#code-of-conduct">
         WG21 code of conduct</a><sup><a title="SD-4: WG21 Practices and Procedures"
                                         href="#ref_wg21_coc">[WG21_COC]</a></sup>.</li>
  <li>Assuming a capable product, users will be able to report CoC violations
      from within the chat service.  Such reports will not be anonymous, but
      the reporter will only be known to the moderators that receive these
      reports.  Moderators will only be authorized to share the identify of the
      reporter as required for administrative purposes.</li>
  <li>Use of the chat service will not be required for participation in any WG,
      SG, or AG face to face meeting or telecon.  The service will be used only
      for informal communications and discussions and does not displace use of
      any existing services.  Formal communications will continue to be
      conducted via the existing mailing lists.</li>
  <li>The chat service will be used in preference to the existing IRC and Slack
      workspace previously used for coordination at face to face meetings.</li>
  <li>Assuming a capable product, a service that mimics the <tt>npaperbot</tt>
      bot on Slack will be provided.</li>
  <li>Assuming a capable product, users will be able to register and use custom
      emoji.  Custom emoji will be subject to CoC concerns in the same manner
      as other text.</li>
</ul>
