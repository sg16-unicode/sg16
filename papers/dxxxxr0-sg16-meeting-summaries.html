<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A round of introductions was held for the benefit of new attendees.</li>
  <li>Zach asked for everyone to contribute to the Boost.Text review scheduled
      to start on the following day, June 13th.
    <ul>
      <li>Contributors will need to subscribe to the
          <a href="https://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost">boost@lists.boost.org</a>
          mailing list at
          <a href="https://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost">https://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost</a>.</li>
      <li>An introductory invitation for SG16 members was posted to the SG16
          mailing list and is available at
          <a href="https://lists.isocpp.org/sg16/2020/06/1499.php">https://lists.isocpp.org/sg16/2020/06/1499.php</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tom mentioned that work has progressed on establishing a shared calendar
      for all WG21 telecons.  Official announcements are expected soon.  For
      now, BlueJeans calendar invites will continue to be sent as usual, but
      may be discontinued in the future if the shared calendar works well for
      everyone.</li>
  <li>Discuss terminology updates to strive for in C++23
    <ul>
      <li>Tom introduced the topic.
        <ul>
          <li>Per prior meetings, modernizing terminology in the standard is an
              SG16 goal for C++23.</li>
          <li>Tom expressed uncertainty with regard to the best starting point
              for discussion, but suggested starting by reviewing a set of
              existing terms used in the standard that he included in an
              <a href="https://lists.isocpp.org/sg16/2020/06/1484.php">email to the SG16 mailing list</a>
              right before the meeting.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Corentin expressed desire to take a holistic approach to updating the
          wording and directed attention to his
          <a href="https://lists.isocpp.org/sg16/2020/06/1460.php">D2178R0 draft attached to a message sent to the SG16 mailing list</a>.</li>
      <li>Corentin suggested splitting the effort to focus first on core
          wording, then on library wording.</li>
      <li>PBrett opined that core wording will be difficult and would prefer a
          single paper to address it, but potentially multiple papers to address
          library wording.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted that some library components treat non-text as text.  For
          example, file names, command line arguments, stream contents, and
          environment variables.</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested inserting a third phase up front to just establish
          terminology itself.</li>
      <li>Alisdair agreed noting that commonly understood terminology provides
          the tools necessary to discuss wording.</li>
      <li>Steve expressed a desire to introduce new terms in order to facilitate
          easier communication; specifically new short terms that can substitute
          for otherwise wordy phrasing.</li>
      <li>Steve stated that we'll need to re-word with expectation of impact to
          existing implementations.</li>
      <li>Tom agreed noting that he ran into such situations drafting
          <a href="https://wg21.link/p2029">P2029</a>.
          This happens due to interaction with core issues and discovery of
          existing conformance issues in implementations.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied that any such impact should be minimal, and should
          effectively be bug fixes, each of which has limited impact to existing
          implementations.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked if we have general agreement for splitting the work in
          three phases as indicated.</li>
      <li>No objections were raised.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that we may need to introduce new terms.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested that, perhaps, we should start discussion with
          <em>character</em> first.</li>
      <li>Hubert responded that
          <a href="https://wg21.link/p1859r0">P1859R0</a>
          already discussed <em>abstract character</em> and no one raised
          concerns.</li>
      <li>Discussion turned to the first item in the list of terms Tom sent to
          the mailing list, "The encoding of source files".</li>
      <li>Someone noted that the source may not be a file, or even a digital
          resource with an encoding in any traditional sense.</li>
      <li>Steve responded that Richard Smith is a conforming implementation of
          the standard.</li>
      <li>Alisdair asked if the standard should rule out source files contained
          in .zip files.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that he wasn't aware of such translation phase 1 abilities
          being challenged and that any proposed changes should strive to
          preserve such abilities.</li>
      <li>Corentin observed that, if the source input is an image, there is no
          traditional character encoding or character set, but a stream of
          characters is still available.</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested that it may be useful to introduce the notion of a
          logical source file that is distinct from any physical
          representation.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that a path through that logical representation is
          currently required to retrieve original spelling of characters in raw
          string literals.</li>
      <li>Corentin opined that the current machinery works and that it is nice
          to be able to discard the notion of a physical source representation
          after phase 1.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that translation phase 1 does too much for one phase
          right now.</li>
      <li>Corentin agreed and stated a preference that translation phase 1 only
          perform character mapping.</li>
      <li>Jens described how translation phase 1 could be divided into
          sub-phases.  Phase 1A would produce logical characters and phase 1B
          would map to <em>universal-character-name</em>s.</li>
      <li>Jens opined that the notion of physical source file is too limiting;
          other input forms should not be excluded.</li>
      <li>Corentin reiterated his fondness for discarding physical details
          after translation phase 1.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that the current method of reverting portions of
          translation phases 1 and 2 to retrieve the original spelling for raw
          string literals is very hacky; it would be better to preserve the
          original information in a more direct manner.</li>
      <li>Tom asked if there are additional benefits that could be had by
          addressing the raw string literal issue.</li>
      <li>Alisdair responded that, since trigraphs were removed, this scenario
          is now the tail wagging the dog.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that addressing it could solve the
          <a href="https://lists.isocpp.org/sg16/2020/06/1469.php">issue recently discussed on the SG16 mailing list</a>
          involving EBCDIC characters that get converted to
          <em>universal-character-name</em>s that are not semantically
          preserving.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that we still have outstanding issues with raw string
          literals and new line characters.</li>
      <li>Corentin suggested that introduction of an additional character
          mapping may be heading in the wrong direction; we want to make things
          simpler and being able to focus solely on Unicode post translation
          phase 1 would help that goal.</li>
      <li>Hubert responded that there is a benefit to having the standard
          reflect the general case.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested it would be useful to give this concern a name and move
          on to other discussion.</li>
      <li>Alisdair raised the relationships between character, character set,
          and character encoding.</li>
      <li>Hubert pondered whether we need character repertoire and noted over
          use of the term character set where character encoding is often
          meant.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested discontinuing the use of character set.</li>
      <li>Corentin disagreed noting that the execution character set is a
          character set and that discussion of code points requires a character
          set as opposed to a repertoire.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked why a character repertoire plus an encoding doesn't
          suffice.</li>
      <li>Corentin responded that his explanation was based on Unicode
          definitions.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that use of the Unicode definitions is fine for
          discussion purposes; the basic execution character set is sometimes
          used where an encoding is intended unless you subscribe to the belief
          that <tt>wchar_t</tt> implies a trivial encoding.</li>
      <li>Hubert continued noting that the basic execution character set is
          sometimes used as a repertoire, and at other times used as a character
          set.</li>
      <li>Tom responded that he thinks of the basic execution character set as
          defining a restriction on character sets since it places some
          constraints on code assignments; the code points for digits 0-9 must
          be in sequence, and the code point value for NUL must be 0.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that the abstract numeric values mapped to abstract
          characters are sometimes ficticious.</li>
      <li>Corentin discussed the idea of the internal character set being a
          repertoire; that works up until translation phase 5 when conversions
          for literals produce objects with values.</li>
      <li>Tom provided a description of his understanding of character
          repertoire, character set, and character encoding.  A character
          repertoire is a set of abstract characters.  A character set is a map
          of abstract characters corresponding to some character repertoire to
          numeric code point values.  A character encoding is a specification
          for how to encode those numeric code point values as a sequence of
          code units.</li>
      <li>Tom asked if any of those definitions were surprising.</li>
      <li>PBrett expressed a little surprise with regard to the implied need for
          a character encoding to have an associated character set since an
          encoding could specify how to encode abstract characters
          directly.</li>
      <li>Steve stated that, according to Unicode, a coded character set defines
          a map of characters to numeric code point values, but that a character
          set in general need not specify such mappings.</li>
      <li>Tom asked for confirmation that we should prefer the term coded
          character set when we explicitly mean a map of characters from a
          repertoire to numeric code point values.</li>
      <li>Steve responded, yes.</li>
      <li>PBrett observed that, for ISO/IEC 8859 specifications other than
          ISO/IEC 8859-1, the specified character repertoire is a subset of the
          Unicode character repertoire, but the specified character set is not a
          subset of the Unicode character set since code point assignments
          differ for some non-ASCII cases.</li>
      <li>PBrett also observed that the basic source character set is a
          repertoire, but the compiler must also define an associated coded
          character set.</li>
      <li>Jens responded that that is true from an implementation perspective,
          but not with regard to how the standard uses it since the standard
          permits symbolic evaluation.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that the standard may not be very consistent in how the
          existing terms are used, but the use of terms with fewer requirements
          is useful.</li>
      <li>Hubert expressed concern regarding focus on coded character sets
          because it isn't clear that abstract numeric code point values are
          helpful from a specification standpoint.</li>
      <li>Jens responded that it is convenient to be able to discuss a character
          having a numeric value, but agreed that it is not germane to the
          standard.</li>
      <li>Jens continued stating that, at the end of the day, we need to encode
          bytes for a character that was previously abstract; if the use of the
          character set term is confusing, we can replace it, but that seems
          like an editorial concern, albeit a useful one to avoid confusion or
          reduce baggage.</li>
      <li>PBrett expressed support for a new term since character set is often
          confused with encoding.</li>
      <li>Corentin provided the historical perspective that most legacy
          character encodings were trivial encodings of code points from a given
          coded character set, so the terms were almost always interchangeable
          prior to Unicode.</li>
      <li>Steve stated that numeric code point values for basic source
          characters are not observeable though, per
          <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/cpp.cond#12">[cpp.cond]p12</a>,
          different values corresponding to them may be observed at different
          phases of translation.</li>
      <li>Hubert observed that, within the standard, discussion of character
          sets usually corresponds to the Unicode definition of character
          encoding schemes.</li>
      <li>Tom summarized; it sounds like we likely have need for character
          repertoire and character encoding scheme, but perhaps not for
          character set or coded character set.</li>
      <li>Hubert responded that there may be a need for character set
          specifically when referring to Unicode.</li>
      <li>Tom pondered whether a coded character set is needed for character
          literals.  The current constraint for the value of a character literal
          <em>[ Editor's note: other than for multicharacter literals or
          literals with no representation in the execution character set. ]</em>
          is that the abstract character can be encoded in a single code
          unit.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that the only observable character values are code units
          in Unicode parlance.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked whether <em>unicode-character-name</em>s fits that
          picture.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that we do associate them with Unicode code points, but
          from a standard perspective, they are basically text.</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested use of generalized terminology for these low level
          concerns with Unicode terminology reserved specifically for Unicode
          encodings.</li>
      <li>Alisdair noted that encoding matters can't assume octets.</li>
      <li>Hubert agreed, but noted that some of the ISO blessed specifications
          specify octets and provided a source in chat:
        <ul>
          <li>"(Source: RFC1866) A function whose domain is the set of sequences
              of octets, and whose range is the set of sequences of characters
              from a character repertoire; that is, a sequence of octets and a
              character encoding scheme determining a sequence of
              characters."</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Tom suggested we move on to some polls.</li>
      <li><b>Poll: We should move forward in three phases. 1) define
          terminology, 2) address core wording, 3) address library use of
          terms</b>

          <li><b>No objection to unanimous consent.</b></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Poll: This group generally believes that C++ lexing and parsing

              strict use of abstract characters introduces problems where a
              coded character set contains multiple values for a single abstract
              character/contains characters that are canonically the same but
              assigned different values." ]</em></li>

<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Tom introduced the topic:
    <ul>
      <li>The intent is continuation of discussion from the prior telecon.</li>
      <li>Polls taken during the prior telecon were presented and it was noted
          that mailing list discussions following the telecon may have changed
          opinions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Jens opined that we need more than just a glossary; the mailing list
      discussion raised examples of characters that can not go through
      translation phase 1 without information loss.  This means we cannot
      convert to Unicode universally without loss.</li>
  <li>Tom raised a qustion that Corentin had asked him during private discussion
      following the telecon.  Corentin had asked if, given a string literal and
      a raw string literal where both are specified with the same source input
      characters (with extended characters but without escape sequences),
      whether both strings must have the same encoded contents after translation
      phase 5.</li>
  <li>PBrett responded that some people assert that raw string literals should
      effectively copy the byte sequence from the souce input.</li>
  <li>Corentin disagreed with such an interpretation and noted that conversions
      are required.</li>
  <li>Tom presented two possible models for the reversion of
      <em>universal-character-name</em>s (UCNs) in raw string literals during
      translation phase 5.
    <ul>
      <li>The UCN is reverted to the original source input character and that
          character is then encoded in the appropriate encoding for the kind
          of string literal.</li>
      <li>The UCN is reverted to the code point denoted by the UCN and that
          code point is then encoded in the appropriate encoding for the kind
          of string literal.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Corentin opined that the reversion can be accomplished via the as-if rule
      and translation phase 1 and 5 shenanigans.</li>
  <li>Tom asked Jens to comment on Corentin's interpretation of the as-if rule
      in this context from a core perspective.</li>
  <li>Jens responded that the question is whether a conforming program could
      observe the difference.</li>
  <li>Tom replied that implementation-defined behavior is unavoidable here, so
      the standard can't fully define the behavior on its own.</li>
  <li>Corentin stated that, if you have a Unicode character, conversion to
      Shift-JIS provides a choice of code point values for some characters.</li>
  <li>PBrett noted that the program can distinuish behavior here.</li>
  <li>Corentin replied that the original source file encoding can't be
      observed.</li>
  <li>Martinho noted that a program can demonstrate the behavior though.</li>
  <li>Jens stated that programmers have expectations of behavior based on their
      source file encoding; they expect what they write to be carried
      through.</li>
  <li>Tom asked if it would be conforming for an implementation to, given an
      'Å' (U+00C5, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE) or
      'Å' (U+212B, ANGSTROM SIGN) in the source input, to always translate
      both to one or the other in the execution character set.</li>
  <li>Corentin replied that, for Unicode input, we can require preservation of
      code points.</li>
  <li>PBrett asked if the standard currently permits such translation.</li>
  <li>Steve responded that translation phase 1 is so loose that any imaginable
      conversion is conforming and provided handling of trigraphs as an
      example.</li>
  <li>Jens agreed and elaborated; translation phase 1 states that physical
      source files are mapped in an implementation-defined manner and that
      mapping can include recognizing and mutating string literals.</li>
  <li>Martinho claimed that an implementation can even recognize every source
      input file as equivalent!</li>
  <li>Jens agreed, but noted that the implementation has to actually define
      what it does.</li>
  <li>PBrett noted the utility of such lenience; for Shift-JIS we only need
      implementation-defined behavior on the input side.</li>
  <li>Steve responded that the conversion to execution character set for
      Shift-JIS could be lossy, but for the Unicode A-with-ring vs
      Angstrom-sign case, it need not be.</li>
  <li>Martinho observed that, if a UCN isn't explicitly written in the source,
      the implementation has freedom to handle the conversion however is
      desired.</li>
  <li>Tom replied that the implementation has such freedom regardless of
      whether the UCN is explicit due to translation phase 1 leniency.</li>
  <li>Corentin stated that leaving these conversions as implementation-defined
      for now will allow us to make progress.</li>
  <li>Jens observed that, for a hypothetical future where Unicode code point
      pass through is required, the implementation-defined steps in between
      can be removed.</li>
  <li>Mark asked if, in that world, whether raw string literals would still
      have to revert UCNs.</li>
  <li>Jens responded yes; translation phase 1 could simulate Unicode input.</li>
  <li>Tom observed that recognition of tokens in translation phase 3 depends on
      UCNs and asked, when a UCN is reverted, what it is reverted to.</li>
  <li>Jens responded that it is reverted to an extended character.</li>
  <li>Tom replied that extended characters are not reflected in the grammar and
      stated that this has implications for the stringize operator in the case
      where a macro name spelled with an extended character is stringized.</li>
  <li>PBrett stated that an extended character is any character in the internal
      character set that is not a member of the basic source character set.</li>
  <li>Corentin stated that the mapping from every extended character to a UCN
      is required.</li>
  <li>Hubert noted that the internal character set is effectively Unicode and
      that this differs from the model used for C.</li>
  <li>Jens agreed and observed that the requirement only exists because extended
      characters must be representable as a UCN.</li>
  <li>PBrett asked if this avoids the need to discuss the Unicode character
      set.</li>
  <li>Jens responded that that is the status quo; the question is whether we
      need to carve an exception for extended characters that don't roundtrip
      through Unicode and whether that is desirable or whether loss of some
      information is ok.</li>
  <li>Jens noted that the UCN mechanism permits translation through an ASCII
      only preprocessor.</li>
  <li>Jens summarized; there are two reasonable positions:
    <ul>
      <li>The status quo; the standard doesn't recognize the existence of
          characters that don't roundtrip through Unicode, or</li>
      <li>The standard should be updated to recognize the possibility of such
          characters and specify behavior for them.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Corentin agreed with Jens' summary, but noted another possible position,
      the standard could specify conversion via Unicode, but require semantic
      preservation for extended characters.</li>
  <li>PBrett asked if the internal character set could be replaced with the
      Unicode character set since the standard requires it to be isomorphic
      anyway.</li>
  <li>Jens expressed concerns about doing so since that would require defining
      behavior for unassigned code points.</li>
  <li>Hubert stated that some implementations map characters to a limited
      internal character set that only supports the current locale; conversion
      through Unicode is a complicated process to get a simple result for
      round tripping.</li>
  <li>Hubert observed that C already adopted a model that doesn't force the
      internal character set to be Unicode.</li>
  <li>Jens noted that C supports UCNs and asked how its model avoids these
      issues.</li>
  <li>Hubert referenced the
      <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf">"C99 rationale" document</a>
      and explained that it documents three models for handling UCNs.  C chose
      one model and C++ chose another.</li>
  <li>Hubert noted that limitations with regard to eager conversion of extended
      characters to UCNs in translation phase 1 effectively requiring all
      extended characters to have representation in Unicode are not discussed
      in the document.</li>
  <li>PBrett asked if implementations that support extended characters not
      represented in Unicode would become non-conforming if the internal
      character set was defined as being Unicode.</li>
  <li>Hubert responded that no, the model adopted for C++ that permits
      observability of UCNs is defective; it seems that C++ failed to specify
      the intended behavior.</li>
  <li>[ <em>Editor's note: The referenced
      <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf">"C99 rationale" document</a>,
      in section 5.2.1, subsection "UCN models", states:</em>
      <div style="padding: .5em; background: #E9FBE9">
      Once this was adopted, there was still one problem, how to specify UCNs in
      the Standard.  Both the C and C++ committees studied this situation and
      the available solutions, and drafted three models:<br/>
        <div style="padding: .5em; background: #E9FBE9">
        A. Convert everything to UCNs in basic source characters as soon as
        possible, that is, in translation phase 1.<br/>
        B. Use native encodings where possible, UCNs otherwise.<br/>
        C. Convert everything to wide characters as soon as possible using an
        internal encoding that encompasses the entire source character set and
        all UCNs.<br/>
        </div>
      Furthermore, in any place where a program could tell which model was being
      used, the standard should try to label those corner cases as undefined
      behavior.
      </div>
      ]
  </li>
  <li>Jens summarized; the UCN model was chosen by C++ decades ago and it has
      issues.  C chose a different model, and Hubert suggests that use of that
      model would not require round trip through Unicode and thus may make more
      programs well-formed.</li>
  <li>PBrett asked if the C model retains the notion of an internal character
      set.</li>
  <li>Hubert responded that C's model doesn't introduce UCNs in translation
      phase 1; rather it has extended characters and wording that achieves the
      same result.  C has explicit wording to handle basic and extended
      characters.</li>
  <li>Jens asked how C avoids handling UCNs in a character literal.</li>
  <li>Hubert responded that C doesn't have to define the special property of
      what can be encoded in a character literal.</li>
  <li>Hubert noted that, if we move away from UCNs, it will be necessary to add
      wording to handle extended characters.</li>
  <li>PBrett stated that it sounds like the C model permits the internal
      character set to be a super set of Unicode.</li>
  <li>Tom noted that Corentin and Steve have both expressed a preference for
      translating extended characters to Unicode code points that are maintained
      distinctly from UCNs.</li>
  <li>Hubert responded that code point is just a term.  If we switch models,
      then we'll need to add wording to handle these scenarios; it might not be
      less wording than is needed for UCNs.</li>
  <li>Corentin agreed, but noted that it would avoid the need for the UCN
      reversion that currently happens in raw string literals and stringize
      operations.</li>
  <li>PBrett asked how the notion of an extended character differs from a code
      point; code point has an implied character set association, but extended
      character doesn't.</li>
  <li>Hubert responded that there is a distinction: extended character excludes
      basic source characters.  This distinction may not be useful.</li>
  <li>Jens expressed concern about potentially losing that distinction since
      extended characters can only appear in a limited number of contexts.</li>
  <li>Corentin expressed a preference for use of common terminology and that
      extended characters would make it difficult to discuss behavior in Unicode
      terms.</li>
  <li>Hubert noted that extended characters just provide differentiation from
      basic source characters because the latter have additional requirements
      placed on them.</li>
  <li>PBrett observed that code points require correlation with a character set,
      but that an extended character can have distinct code points in a single
      character set.</li>
  <li>Steve noted that code point values don't tend to be observable but that
      code units are.</li>
  <li>Hubert stated that the term code point is probably not correct to describe
      a character that can apply generically to multiple character sets.</li>
  <li>Steve listed some of the requirements for the members of the basic
      execution character set; each such character is encoded as a single code
      unit with a non-negative value, and the code unit values for the digits
      0-9 have consecutive values.</li>
  <li>Jens noted that the term "code point" implies an associated numeric value,
      but that such a value is not needed within the standard for the source
      input character set.  Further, on the execution side, it should not be
      assumed that code points are encoded.  A term that is more abstract than
      code point is needed here.</li>
  <li>Hubert agreed that numeric code point values are not needed, but noted
      that abstract character isn't necessarily the right term either.</li>
  <li>Corentin stated that code point could imply a numeric value, but that the
      standard need not discuss it.</li>
  <li>Tom replied that, in ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode, code point is primarily
      defined as a numeric value.</li>
  <li>Hubert observed that, if the internal character set is specified to be
      Unicode, then there is no requirement to define what a "chraracter" is,
      but use of a term like "extended character" will require avoiding
      discussion of details since they would be implementation-defined.</li>
  <li>Jens observed that implementations could use code point values above
      <tt>0x10FFFF</tt> for extended characters.</li>
  <li>Jens added that there is benefit to being aligned with C if we were to
      adopt the C99 model.</li>
  <li>Jens opined that there is no benefit in requiring the internal character
      set to be isomorphic to Unicode.</li>
  <li>PBrett stated that the alternative to an internal character set is
      Unicode and expressed a preference that, if the internal character set is
      effectively Unicode, that it just be made Unicode.</li>
  <li>Hubert responded that the goal was to avoid formation of UCNs in
      translation phase 1 and that doing so results in having to handle extended
      characters.  That implies that the internal character set must map Unicode
      or Unicode plus additional implementation-defined characters.</li>
  <li><b>Poll: We generally believe that the internal character set should be
      Unicode based, but that implementations can support non-Unicode
      characters.</b>

<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Discussion of the suitability of
      <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69119.html">ISO/IEC 10646:2017</a>
      terms for use in the C++ standard
    <ul>
      <li>Tom introduced the topic:
        <ul>
          <li>The intent is to focus on terminology, determine what terms from
              ISO/IEC 10646 are usable in the C++ standard and for what
              purposes, and what new terms will be needed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Zach advised against introducing new terms or redefining existing
          terms with different meanings.</li>
      <li>Hubert agreed that if we try inventing terms, then we risk causing
          some of the same problems that the Unicode consortium did by making
          terms overly specific; we want generic terms.</li>
      <li>PBrett also agreed and noted that we don't want to create an N+1
          specification.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that there may not be much reason for concern; the
          proposed wording for
          <a href="https://wg21.link/p2029">P2029</a>
          illustrates that we can avoid the need for some terms.  For example,
          we may be able to get rid of execution character set completely by
          only discussing an execution encoding rather than a character
          set.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked Jens to confirm that only character encodings can be
          observed, not character sets.</li>
      <li>Jens replied, yes.</li>
      <li>The group proceeded to discuss terms from ISO/IEC 10646.

              <li>Jens commented that he used to believe that ISO/IEC 10646
                  matched the Unicode standard, but the ISO/IEC 10646 terms
                  differ from Unicode.</li>
              <li>Tom acknowledged and relayed his understanding that we are
                  required to refer to ISO standards when they exist, so we
                  need to first consider the terms from ISO/IEC 10646.</li>
              <li>Jens confirmed that understanding.</li>
              <li>Hubert asked where we envision using the "character" term from
                  ISO/IEC 10646 in the standard.</li>
              <li>Jens replied that we need a term for the members of the basic
                  source character set and for the input source.</li>
              <li>Tom added that we may need the term for the entity that is
                  designated by a simple escape sequence.</li>
              <li>Jens responded that, since simple escape sequences designate
                  an execution time value, that entity can be a code unit
                  sequence.</li>
              <li>Hubert noted that all of the characters designated by simple
                  escape sequences only require a single code unit, not even a
                  code unit sequence.</li>
              <li>Hubert noted that the designated code units do have associated
                  semantics however; like BEL for example.</li>
              <li>Jens replied that semantics can be established by referring to
                  the character name or to a Unicode code point.</li>
              <li>Hubert expressed support for the generality of that approach
                  since it is required that the mapping to execution encoding
                  can't fail.</li>
              <li>PBrett asked if there is a need for the concept of a character

              <li>Jens replied that there may be, but that we should just focus
                  on core language for now and locale is all run-time.</li>

              <li>Tom replied that any dependent terms are already available via
                  the existing reference to ISO/IEC 10646.</li>
              <li>Jens stated that the list of terms in the telecon agenda are

              <li>Tom decreed that the definition is terrible since it requires
                  "UCS codespace".</li>
              <li>Jens read the definition of "UCS codespace".</li>
              <li>Jens noted that "UCS codespace" includes surrogate code

              <li>Zach stated that surrogate inclusion is intentional, but
                  people often use code point where scalar value is intended;
                  we'll need more precision in wording.</li>
              <li>Tom asked if an analogue of code point for non-Unicode
                  encodings is needed.</li>
              <li>Jens replied no, only code units are needed; even for
                  character literals.</li>
              <li>Hubert expressed some uncertainty and that something like code
                  point may be needed for <em>universal-character-name</em>s
                  (UCNs).</li>
              <li>Jens summarized Hubert's concern and stated that UCNs are a
                  sequence of characters that designate a scalar value and that
                  we need to be able to state that the universal character set

              <li>Steve mentioned short-identifier syntax, <tt>U+XXXX</tt>, and
                  noted that, in a UCN, the <tt>XXXX</tt> is the
                  short-identifier.</li>
              <li>Jens replied that short-identifier syntax is problematic
                  because of restrictions on leading 0s; Unicode only allows
                  leading 0s to pad to a maximum length of 6 digits, but UCNs
                  require a length of exactly 4 or 8 digits.</li>

              <li>Jens agreed, but noted that for backward compatibility, a

              <li>Jens stated that neither of the "well-formed" terms are
                  interesting for core language.</li>
              <li>Tom countered that these could potentially be useful for a
                  fully specified translation phase 1 for Unicode encoded
                  source files.</li>
              <li>PBrett stated that, absent implementation defects, it is not
                  possible for literals to not be well-formed.</li>
              <li>Zach expressed uncertainty.</li>
              <li>Hubert noted that, for source input, all that exists are
                  characters and UCNs, so yes, well-formedness is assured.</li>
              <li>Steve agreed and added that we've previously agreed that
                  ill-formed code unit sequences in literals are possible due
                  to numeric escape sequences, but that the input to the literal
                  encoding is always well-formed.</li>
              <li>Mark expressed surprise that these terms are not needed in the
                  code language.</li>
              <li>Tom replied that library will eventually need these terms or
                  analogous ones.</li>
              <li>Zach agreed that we should revisit these terms for
                  library.</li>

              EXAMPLE - An unpaired surrogate code unit is an ill-formed code

              Note 1 - An ill-formed code unit sequence subset cannot overlap
              with a minimal well-formed code unit sequence.

              <li>Tom stated that the situation is the same for the "ill-formed"
                  cases as for the "well-formed" ones; they can be used in
                  library, but are not needed for core language.</li>

  <li>Tom stated that this meeting concludes our discussion of terminology
      for now and that a paper will be needed to make more progress.</li>
