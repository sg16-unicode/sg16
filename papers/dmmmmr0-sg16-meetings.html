<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><em>[ Editor's note: We did not have quorum due to low attendance;
      as a result, no polls were taken. ]</em></li>
  <li><em>[ Editor's note: Changes made in a draft of
      <a href="https://wg21.link/p1885r9">P1885R9</a>
      were material to review of the papers on the agenda, so we first
      reviewed it. ]</em></li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p1885r9">P1885R9: Naming Text Encodings to Demystify Them</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Jens stated that there is a procedural question related to the
          changes made in this revision; the new draft changes the design
          after electronic polling.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that the changes were at least partially inspired by
          comments received on the proposal by electronic polling participants
          and were intended to increase consensus.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted that the polled revision did not have the wording to
          mandate <tt>CHAR_BIT == 8</tt> due to a procedural error and asked
          whether that warranted follow up with LEWG.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked what it means in practice for the wording to mandate
          <tt>CHAR_BIT == 8</tt>.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that it requires a call to a function specified with
          that wording to be ill-formed if the requirement is violated.</li>
      <li>Jens explained that implementors can conform with this requirement
          by defining such functions as deleted, implementing them as a
          function template with an appropriate <tt>static_assert</tt>, or
          similar.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked for more details regarding implementation as a function
          template and whether the functions could simply not be declared
          at all.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that a function template is ok because taking the address
          of a standard library function is not allowed; the standard just
          requires a call expression to be well-formed.</li>
      <li>Hubert explained that the name must be declared due to interaction
          with name lookup.</li>
      <li>Jens stated an implementation preference to define the function as
          deleted.</li>
      <li>PBrett: noticed that the revision history simply stated
          "Wording fixes" with no details.</li>
      <li>Tom volunteered to review the R8 and R9 revisions and to summarize
          the differences in the meeting summary.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: Tom did so; the wording differences identified include:
        <ul>
          <li>An additional <tt>using enum id</tt> declaration was added to
              the definition of <tt>text_encoding</tt>.</li>
          <li>The <tt>wide_literal()</tt>, <tt>wide_environment()</tt>, and
              <tt>wide_environment_is()</tt> declarations were removed and
              wording that referred to them adjusted accordingly.</li>
          <li>"character encoding" was changed to "character encoding scheme"
              in the paragraph following the note regarding how the names of
              <tt>text_encoding::id</tt> enumerators were derived from the
              IANA registry.</li>
          <li>A paragraph describing invariants maintained by
              <tt>text_encoding</tt> was added.</li>
          <li>Wording that introduced and used
              <tt>SUBSTITUTE_UTF_ENCODING()</tt> for mapping the bigendian and
              littleendian UTF-16 and UTF-32 schemes to their respective
              encoding forms was removed; related wording was adjusted
              accordingly.</li>
          <li>Wording to mandate <tt>CHAR_BIT == 8</tt> was added
              throughout.</li>
        </ul>
      ]</em>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p2491r0">P2491R0: Text encodings follow-up</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Jens summarized the paper.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that the changes in P1885R9 improve consistency with the
          IANA intent and P1885 usage.</li>
      <li>Jens added that there is opportunity for specification improvements,
          but that they can be addressed during LWG review.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that the wording plan described in the paper indicated
          intent to remove the requirement that <tt>CHAR_BIT == 8</tt>.</li>
      <li>Jens confirmed, but expressed a lack of concern; that restriction can
          be removed if motivation to do so arises.</li>
      <li>PBrett expressed a preference for explicit specification for how IANA
          octets are mapped to C++ code units.</li>
      <li>Jens agreed, stated that can be done during LWG review, and expressed
          a preference for a normative sentence that maps an IANA octet to a
          <tt>char</tt> code unit.</li>
      <li>Jens expressed a belief that relying on IANA for anything other than
          octets would be a mistake.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked if Jens had an alternative to suggest.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that he did not, but that such concerns usually arose
          during discussion of UTF-16 and UTF-32.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that mapping to IANA in those cases is feasible, but
          noted that there are multiple possible mappings that may be platform
          dependent; particularly when the size of <tt>char</tt> is not 8
          bits.</li>
      <li>PBrett agreed, but noted that a particular mapping could be required
          for a conforming implementation.</li>
      <li>Tom added that a non-conforming implementation would map to "other"
          in that case.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p2498r0">P2498R0: Forward compatibility of text_encoding with additional encoding registries</a>
    <ul>
      <li>PBrett introduced the proposal:
        <ul>
          <li>Character encoding repositories other than IANA exist.</li>
          <li>The mapping to IANA should be explicit such that a mapping to
              another registry could be gracefully introduced in the future if
              motivation arises.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>PBrett summarized the proposed changes:
        <ul>
          <li>Rename "id" to "iana_id"</li>
          <li>Rename "mib" to "iana_mib"</li>
          <li>Add recommended practice to avoid implementations creating an
              over dependence on IANA.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>PBrett asked for opinions on the proposed renames.</li>
      <li>Victor asked if other viable candidate registries exist in practice
          and stated that, if not, the proposed renames seem premature.</li>
      <li>PBrett replied that there are NB concerns about IANA being an
          unregulated, unaccountable, and unreliable organization.</li>
      <li>PBrett added that examples of other registries can be found in the
          <a href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org">WhatWG Encoding Standard</a>,
          IBM's <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/G01BQVRV">Character Data Representation Architecture (CDRA)</a>,
          and <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/22747.html">ISO/IEC 2022:1994</a>.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted that the paper does not propose the addition of another
          registry; just the possibility to add more in the future in a
          seamless manner.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested adding examples of other registries to the paper.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded with concern that doing so might create disruption
          for the advancement of P1885 and result in considerable time spent
          debating whether the merits of each such repository warrant their
          being mentioned.</li>
      <li>Steve asked for confirmation that, assuming an additional registry,
          that a single text encoding ID is still needed.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that the IANA ID is an enum class and that, in
          principle, multiple such classes are possible.</li>
      <li>Steve stated that renaming <tt>mib()</tt> to <tt>iana_mib()</tt>
          results in the feature no longer being generic.</li>
      <li>Jens agreed.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that code written for P1885 today that consults
          <tt>mib()</tt> is necessarily concerned with IANA specifically.</li>
      <li>Steve asked what function a generic library should call then.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that, if the IANA ID is desired, then call
          <tt>mib()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that, since multiple encodings may map to IANA's "other",
          reliance on <tt>mib()</tt> to uniquely identify an encoding is not
          possible.</li>
      <li>Hubert opined that the proposed renames are fine, but that
          extension to other registries might require different
          terminology.</li>
      <li>Jens offered examples such as "unique ID" and "UUID".</li>
      <li>Jens opined that it doesn't hurt to add "iana" to make the
          terminology association explicit.</li>
      <li>Hubert agreed.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that, for wide encodings, there are some registries
          that are somewhat suitable; in CDRA, wide encodings aren't explicitly
          represented as they constitute a composition of a character set and
          an encoding.</li>
      <li>PBrett acknowledged and noted that the proposal is intended to clear
          design space for extension for such cases.</li>
      <li>Tom provided some arguments in favor of support for multiple
          registries:
        <ul>
          <li>As previously noted, the IANA specification is goverened by an
              organization that some have concerns about.</li>
          <li>The IANA registry is poor from a quality of specification
              perspective.</li>
          <li>The IANA registry is missing entries that are found in other
              registries.</li>
          <li>The same name is sometimes used by different registries to refer
              to differenc encodings.</li>
          <li>Other registries are arguably more suitable for some environments;
              e.g., CDRA for IBM environments.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Tom suggested that the proposal replace the P1885 proposed exposition
          only data members with post conditions on the default constructor to
          require <tt>iana_mib()</tt> and <tt>name()</tt> to return
          <tt>id::other</tt> and an empty string respectively; this is to avoid
          encouraging implementations to simply store an IANA ID.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted that much of the current wording is in terms of the
          <tt>mib_</tt> exposition only data member.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that those can be changed to <tt>mib()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Jens pointed out that the following text from the proposed wording
          creates the impression that the specified feature provides a remote
          API interface.
        <ul>
          <li>"[text.encoding] describes an interface for accessing the IANA
              Character Sets registry".</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Jens stated that <tt>text_encoding</tt> currently containes a list of
          all encodings in the IANA registry and that this proposal makes the
          <tt>text_encoding</tt> class more of a first class entity for which
          mapping to other registries is ancillary functionality.</li>
      <li>Jens opined that this direction suggests the need to create our own
          encoding registry since the functionality effectively defines
          one.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that such a change constitutes a change in direction that
          is more significant than the proposed renames suggest.</li>
      <li>PBrett acknowledged that the proposal makes the design more abstract
          in a manner similar to how Unicode specifies abstract characters.</li>
      <li>PBrett added that he could imagine a C++ appendix that lists the
          encodings, but that would then necessitate defining them.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that a registration service could be established, but did
          not advise doing so.</li>
      <li>Jens observed that discussion has not yet reached the bottom of how
          encodings would be mapped between encodings registered with different
          registries.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested the possibility of defining an
          <tt>iana_text_encoding</tt> class and later adding an
          <tt>iso_text_encoding</tt> class or similar for other registries if
          warranted.</li>
      <li>Hubert observed that the P1885 design contains the same mapping
          problem since it presents a single domain, but doesn't adhere solely
          to that domain.</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested the possibility of a <tt>text_encoding</tt> class
          template parameterized by a registry identifier.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that, if one were to map the encodings present in the
          <a href="https://icu4c-demos.unicode.org/icu-bin/convexp">ICU converter explorer</a>,
          then parameterization by registry is necessary due to conflicting
          use of the same name for different encodings.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: For example, "korean" maps to "windows-949-2000"
          via the "Windows" provider, but to "ibm-1363_P11B-1998" via the "IANA"
          provider. ]</em></li>
      <li>PBrett reiterated the intent of this proposal; to remove complete
          dependency on IANA.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that the proposed change is consistent with the P1885
          direction given that comparison is dependent on name when an encoding
          maps to IANA's "other".</li>
      <li>Tom opined that there is no need to specify a mapping between
          repositories in the standard; the mapping can be
          implementation-defined.</li>
      <li>Jens agreed that leaving the mapping implementation-defined is
          possible but felt an obligation to specify the mapping.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that, for implementors, the concern is what is in the
          interest of their users.</li>
      <li>PBrett expressed a belief that creation of a character encoding
          registry service would be outside the scope of WG21 work, but that he
          would be willing to assist with such an effort outside of WG21.</li>
      <li>Jens agreed and noted that such a service would essentially be
          attending to graves.</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested that <tt>text_encoding</tt> may be more appropriate
          as a concept.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that distinct classes or class template specializations
          for each registry would create friction at interface boundaries.</li>
      <li>Hubert responded that a type erased interface could still be
          specified.</li>
      <li>PBrett expressed being open to other suggestions.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested renaming the current <tt>text_encoding</tt> class to
          <tt>iana_text_encoding</tt> and, if motivation arises for another
          registry, then a new class can be added.</li>
      <li>General discussion ensued regarding the ramification of distinct
          classes.</li>
      <li>Tom pondered what name would be returned by <tt>name()</tt> if

<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Tom informed the group of tentative plans for a SSRG and SG16 joint
      telecon to discuss the security aspects of
      <a href="https://wg21.link/p2528r0">P2528R0 (C++ Identifier Security using Unicode Standard Annex 39)</a>
      and asked for feedback or concerns about such a meeting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p2286r6">P2286R6: Formatting Ranges</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>Tom informed the group that Barry was unable to be in attendance but
          that we are ok to discuss the wording and gather feedback for
          him.</li>
      <li>Victor explained that he had assisted with the wording related to
          escape handling, but that Barry authored the rest.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that it is generally not advised to discuss a paper
          without the author present.</li>
      <li>Tom acknowledged the guidance and reported that he had communicated
          with Barry and that Barry was content with Victor being present to
          discuss any issues that are raised.</li>
      <li>Jens asked for confirmation that LEWG has already approved the
          design.</li>
      <li>Victor responded that the paper is present in the currently active
          electronic polling cycle.</li>
      <li>Victor shared the paper and reviewed the revision history.</li>
      <li>Victor began reviewing the wording.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked if the <tt>formattable</tt> concept has semantic
          constraints that cannot be expressed in the concept definition.</li>
      <li>Victor replied that it does not.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that, in section 5.1 of the paper, [format.formattable]
          paragraph 2 states the semantic requirements.</li>
      <li>Zach asked if the concept has been implemented as specified.</li>
      <li>Victor expressed uncertainty regarding the concept definition, but
          assured the group that the rest of the design has been
          implemented.</li>
      <li>Mark asked, with regard to section 5.2, why '?' appears as a
          type.</li>
      <li>Victor explained a requirement for mutual exclusivity.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked if there is intent to standardize the use of '?' to
          enable a debug representation generally; e.g., for non-standard
          types.</li>
      <li>Victor replied that doing so is outside the scope of the standard,
          but expressed support for that direction.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted that the paper introduces a <tt>set_debug_format()</tt>
          member function and asked if it would be desirable to add generic
          support for invoking it.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that the parser for the formatted type would presumably
          have to be responsible for recognizing the '?' character and invoking
          the member function.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that calls to <tt>set_debug_format()</tt> must activate
          the debug format regardless of whether a '?' is present in the format
          string.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested that adding generic facilities to support the '?'
          specifier would be ok, but probably best addressed by a different
          paper.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that, in the proposed wording for
          [format.string.escaped], subparagraph 2.4.1, that the "Other" ("C")
          value of <tt>General_Category</tt> is an abbreviation for a set of
          categories and requested that the wording specify the individual
          categories.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: The values for <tt>General_Category</tt> are
          specified in
          <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/tr44-28.html#General_Category_Values">table 12 of section 5.7.1 of Unicode 14 UAX#44</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: The wording also refers to the
          <tt>General_Category</tt> value of "Separator" ("Z") that is likewise
          an abbreviation for a set of categories and should presumably be
          expanded as well. ]</em></li>
      <li>Hubert noted that format stability cannot be guaranteed and that
          output will change when newer Unicode standards are adopted.</li>
      <li>Tom asked for confirmation that stability will only be lacking for
          currently unassigned characters.</li>
      <li>Steve replied that this should be further researched and noted that
          the "Unassigned" ("Cn") property is not stable.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that the wording does not address non-Unicode text and
          asked if <tt>isprint()</tt> and <tt>iswprint()</tt> should be used to
          identify non-printable characters in those cases.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that doing so warrants further discussion.</li>
      <li>Hubert pondered whether it would be preferable to map non-Unicode
          characters to Unicode and then proceed with using the Unicode
          character properties.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that, for implementations that support user defined
          encodings, the implementation may not know how to map to Unicode.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that such user defined definitions must define
          categories to be used for <tt>isprint()</tt> and other character
          classification functions, but acknowledged that a mapping to Unicode
          may not be present.</li>
      <li>PBrett stated that [format.string.escaped] paragraph 2 does not state
          how to determine if the string to be escaped is in a Unicode
          encoding.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted that he believes such wording to be present in the
          wording related to field width and suggested it may be desirable to
          generalize that and move it to a central location.</li>
      <li>Steve asked if the determination might be locale dependent.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted that previous guidance was that <tt>std::format()</tt>
          may be used for binary data and that any associated encoding is
          therefore tenuous.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested that, in those cases, a programmer might be advised
          not to use the '?' formatting type.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested it may be reasonable to, again, use the literal
          encoding as a proxy for the potentially locale dependent
          encoding.</li>
      <li>Victor agreed.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that, for the non-Unicode case, determining
          printability would require either locale dependence or preservation
          of the compile-time literal encoding.</li>
      <li>Charlie noted that, historically, the latter would have been
          difficult and that, for Microsoft, the active code page (ACP) was
          used in the past.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that, in a cross-compilation scenario, it is possible
          that the literal encoding is not a defined encoding for the target
          environment.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested that, at some point, we will need to poll whether the
          non-Unicode behavior should be locale dependent or not.</li>
      <li>Hubert expressed acceptance of non-locale dependent behavior for the
          non-Unicode case so long as there is no requirement to match the
          behavior for the Unicode case with regard to emitting hex vs UCN
          notation.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that, if locale dependence is avoided, it will be
          necessary to assume an encoding for characters that are not
          consistently encoded for all locales; like '\' in EBCDIC
          environments.</li>
      <li>Hubert added that doing so might be ok if the choice is determined
          by the literal encoding.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested it may be useful to support opt-in to locale
          dependence via the 'L' modifier.</li>
      <li>Victor stated that the 'L' modifier could be reserved for now.</li>
      <li>Mark noted that the 'L' modifier is currently supported for character
          type.</li>
      <li>Jens pointed out that the changes to [format.formatter.spec]
          paragraph 2 appear to indicate that a declaration of the
          <tt>set_debug_format()</tt> member function in any one of the
          specializations will affect all of them.</li>
      <li>Victor agreed that this wording requires more work.</li>
      <li>Mark asked when a formatter object for which
          <tt>set_debug_format()</tt> was called is reset or what happens when
          the '?' specifier is not applicable to the type.</li>
      <li>Victor replied that it should be an error to specify mutually
          exclusive options or that the last option overrides prior ones but
          that further consideration is required.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that the order of the interior bullets in
          [format.string.escaped] subparagraph 2.2 need to be revised to
          address two issues:
        <ol>
          <li>The algorithm must process the contents of string <tt>S</tt> in
              order.</li>
          <li><tt>S</tt> consists of a sequence of code units, not UCS scalar
              values.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Jens suggested trying to factor out the code unit and UCS scalar
          value cases to avoid the exceptions.</li>
      <li>Charlie stated that the handling of invalid code unit sequences needs
          to be specified since recovery may not always be possible; failure to
          recover could result in output containing a long sequence of values
          in hex notation.</li>
      <li>Jens acknowledged the scenario and agreed that the specification must
          be made clear about that.</li>
      <li>Jens asked what "universal character name escape sequence" is intended
          to mean in [format.string.escaped] subparagraph 2.4.2 and noted that a
          definition does not exist for "universal character name" though one
          does exist for <em>universal-character-name</em>.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that this wording probably should not refer to
          <em>universal-character-name</em> since it describes a grammar
          nonterminal and suggested replacing
          "its universal character name escape sequence" with
          "a sequence of scalar values".</li>
      <li>PBrett agreed.</li>
      <li>Steve pointed out that similar uses of grammar nonterminals appear in
          the wording.</li>
      <li>Jens agreed and suggested that the various "escape sequence" uses
          should be replaced with "a sequence of scalar values in the form
          ...".</li>
      <li>Jens pointed out a grammar issue in the first line of
          [format.string.escaped] paragraph 3;
          "... is equivalent to the escaped string representation a string
          of <tt>C</tt> ...".</li>
      <li>Hubert requested that a note be added to [format.string.escaped]
          paragraph 4 to indicate that behavior is not locale dependent but
          that the encoding may be informed by the literal encoding.</li>
      <li>Jens reported that the expected output noted in the comment for
          example <tt>s3</tt> in [format.string.escaped] paragraph 4 is
          incorrect; there should be two ranges and therefore two sets of
          brackets.</li>
      <li>Tom observed that the examples that follow [format.string.escaped]
          paragraph 4 depict the expected Unicode behavior, but appear to be
          part of paragraph 4 which is specific to non-Unicode behavior.</li>
      <li>Victor agreed there is a presentation issue that needs to be
          addressed there.</li>
      <li>Jens advised moving paragraphs 2 through 6 of [format.range] after
          the <tt>range_formatter</tt> class definition.</li>
      <li>Victor noted that "exposition only" should appear in italics.</li>
      <li>Mark asked why, in the last row of the table associated with
          [format.range] paragraph 6, "?s" is required as opposed to just
          "?".</li>
      <li>PBrett stated that requiring "?s" is inconsistent with the string
          case where "?" can be specified by itself.</li>
      <li>Victor explained that "s" indicates that a range is intended to be
          formatted as a string; "?s" is therefore needed to format the range
          as a string in debug mode.</li>
      <li>PBrett pointed out the "this is equivalent to invoking
          set_brackets({}, {})" note in [format.range] paragraph 5 and asked
          if a programmer is permitted to make such a call.</li>
      <li>Victor replied that the wording is intended for implementors.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked if, when implementing a range formatter, whether it is
          required to implement member functions like
          <tt>set_brackets()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Victor replied that LEWG had discussed this and that the member
          functions are intended to help avoid ABI issues.</li>
      <li>Mark asked if <tt>set_separator()</tt> and <tt>set_brackets()</tt>
          should be restricted to characters and how characters outside the
          basic character set need to be handled in various scenarios such as
          applicability to estimated field width determination.</li>
      <li>Victor replied that the functions accept strings as input.</li>
      <li>Tom reviewed the list of previously discussed design points that were
          noted in the
          <a href="https://lists.isocpp.org/sg16/2022/01/2956.php">email announcing the agenda for the telecon</a>.</li>
      <li>Tom noted the need for wording to address recovery from encoding
          errors.</li>
      <li>Charlie stated that recovery should follow the processes described in
          the
          <a href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org">WHATWG Encoding Standard</a>.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: See
          <a href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#encoders-and-decoders">section 4.1, "Encoders and decoders"</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>Tom noted the need to ensure that <tt>std::filesystem::path</tt> is
          rejected as a formattable range.</li>
      <li>Victor replied that it is rejected by the constraints on the
          <tt>formatter</tt> partial specialization specified in the
          [format.syn] updates; those constraints reject recursive ranges.</li>
      <li>Victor suggested it might be helpful to add a note that
          <tt>std::filesystem::path</tt> is rejected there.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tom announced that the next telecon will be February 9th.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>PBrett presented:
        <ul>
          <li>The R0 revision was reviewed by SG16 a few weeks ago.</li>
          <li>The R1 revision rebases the wording on the latest P1885
              revision.</li>
          <li>The wording was reworked to decouple IANA IDs from the
              exposition only data members.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Victor noticed an unnecessary trailing semicolon following the
          closing brace of the <tt>std</tt> namespace declaration in the
          proposed updates to [text.encoding].</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that Corentin's recently added response to P2498R1 in
          <a href="https://wg21.link/p1885r10">P1885R10</a>
          noted unnecessary use of an enum for the proposed internal details of
          the <tt>text_encoding</tt> class and asked if it was necessary for it
          to be an enum.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that it is exposition only.</li>
      <li>Jens pointed out an existing <tt>using enum id</tt> declaration in
          the <tt>text_encoding</tt> synopsis that should presumably have been
          changed to <tt>using enum iana_id</tt>.</li>
      <li>Jens noted similar renaming updates needed in the postcondition for
          the <tt>text_encoding(iana_id)</tt> constructor where comparisons
          against <tt>id::unknown</tt> and <tt>id::other</tt> are currently
          present.</li>
      <li>Jens observed that the <tt>text_encoding(iana_id)</tt> constructor
          does not state that its argument is stored.</li>
      <li>PBrett explained that such storage is implied by the postcondition
          requirements on the result of calls to <tt>iana_mib()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested that there should be some wording that relates the
          exposition only <tt>id</tt> type to <tt>iana_id</tt>.</li>
      <li>PBrett agreed that could be better specified.</li>
      <li>PBrett indicated that some positive guidance is needed before
          spending further effort on this proposal.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested polling support for the concerns the paper purports to
          address.</li>
      <li>Discussion regarding polls ensued.</li>
      <li><b>Poll 1A: It should be more explicit in the identifiers used by the

          the telecon. The agenda and links used here reference P2513R1 since
          the links to the draft paper were ephemeral.  The published document
          may differ from the reviewed draft revision. ]</em></li>
      <li>JeanHeyd presented:
        <ul>
          <li>The <tt>char8_t</tt> related changes in C++20 made it more
              difficult to write code that works in both C and C++.</li>
          <li>The proposal is intended to improve compatibility with C.</li>
          <li>The proposal provides an escape hatch in C++ to restore some uses
              of UTF-8 string literals with <tt>char</tt>, <tt>signed char</tt>,
              and <tt>unsigned char</tt>.</li>
          <li>The proposal only relaxes array initialization; pointer behavior
              is not changed.</li>
          <li>The changes are intended as a DR against C++20 so that common
              code can be written for C++17, C++20, C++23, and C.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Victor stated that relaxing initialization for arrays but not for
          pointers creates an inconsistency and that he prefers an error.</li>
      <li>Victor added that <tt>signed char</tt> and <tt>unsigned char</tt> are
          commonly used for <tt>int8_t</tt> and <tt>uint8_t</tt> and the
          proposed changes would allow arrays of these types to now be
          initialized by UTF-8 string literals.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd acknowledged this would be the case and is consistent with
          C++11 through C++17.</li>
      <li>Hubert presented a backward compatibilty concern involving overload
          resolution and initialization of parameters of aggregate type using
          list initialization syntax; the following example is well-formed in
          C++20, but would become ill-formed with the proposed change.
<pre style="display:inline"><tt>
  struct A { char8_t s[5]; };
  struct B { char s[5]; };
  void f(A);
  void f(B);
  void foo() {
    f({u8"text"}); // Resolves to f(A) in C++20, ambiguous with the proposed changes.
  }
</tt></pre>
      </li>
      <li>PBrett observed that the overload resolution issue currently exists
          with <tt>signed char</tt> and <tt>unsigned char</tt>.</li>
      <li>Tom asked for confirmation that binding to a reference to an array
          would still be ill-formed.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd replied affirmatively.</li>
      <li>Jens explained that there is an existing special case that permits
          initialization of arrays of <tt>signed char</tt> or
          <tt>unsigned char</tt> by an ordinary string literal.</li>
      <li>PBrett summarized; the overload scenario already exists for
          <tt>char</tt>, <tt>signed char</tt>, and <tt>unsigned char</tt>.</li>
      <li>Jens agreed and suggested adding an annex C entry with the above
          example to note the new ambiguity.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd reviewed the wording.
        <ul>
          <li>The value of the <tt>__cpp_char8_t</tt> feature test macro is
              updated.</li>
          <li>The subsitution of "may" for "can" in [dcl.init.string] is a
              drive by fix done to maintain consistency with the other changes
              to the paragraph.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>JeanHeyd noted that, with the changes, a program that passes a UTF-8
          string literal as an argument for a function parameter of type
          <tt>const char*</tt> remains ill-formed.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd stated that the ability to initialize <tt>char</tt>-based
          arrays with a UTF-8 string literal addresses constexpr concerns in a
          much simpler way than is presented in
          <a href="https://wg21.link/p1423r3">P1423R3 (char8_t backward compatibility remediation)</a>.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked if any consideration was given for addressing these
          concerns with a core issue.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd replied that a core issue wouldn't be appropriate since the
          C++20 changes were deliberate.</li>
      <li>Tom agreed and noted that this aspect of the C++20 changes was
          approved by EWG.</li>
      <li>Jens agreed that a core issue is unlikely to be helpful, especially
          since a paper already exists.</li>
      <li>Jens asserted that EWG should review and, as a DR, this can be
          considered after C++23 feature freeze.</li>
      <li>Hubert observed that the backward compatibility impact to overload
          resolution can be avoided by limiting the allowance to variables of
          array type.</li>
      <li>Jens agreed, but noted that would require more careful
          wordsmithing.</li>

<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Tom reminded the group about the upcoming SSRG meeting on Monday,
      February 28th, and encouraged the contribution of suggested improvements
      for
      <a href="https://wg21.link/p2528">P2528R0 (C++ Identifier Security using Unicode Standard Annex 39)</a>
      to the author.</li>
  <li>Discuss objectives and priorities for C++26:
    <ul>
      <li>Tom asked the group for suggestions on what we should focus on for
          C++26.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested alias barriers as a remaining core language feature
          improvement.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: See
          <a href="https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16/issues/67">SG16 issue #67</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>PBrett suggested improvements for access to command line options and
          environment variables.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: See
          <a href="https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16/issues/66">SG16 issue #66</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>Jens noted the existing practice for the <tt>_wmain()</tt> entry
          point in Microsoft Visual C++.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted the <tt>envp</tt> parameter that POSIX adds to
          <tt>main()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested <tt>std::rope</tt> for chained text segments.</li>
      <li>Steve suggested transcoding and lamented JeanHeyd's absence.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested an owning string type that eschews null
          termination.</li>
      <li>Charles expressed concern that a string type that doesn't ensure
          null termination may not improve security due to programmers
          attempting to pass such data to functions that require a null
          terminated string anyway.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested that implicit conversions could be prohibited.</li>
      <li>Steve noted the usability challenges such prohibition creates.</li>
      <li>Victor stated that programmers will misuse such types even if
          implicit conversions are not supported; they will assume that, for
          example, a <tt>data()</tt> member function will provide a null
          terminated string.</li>
      <li>PBrett replied that such concerns apply to the existing
          <tt>std::string_view</tt> type as well.</li>
      <li>PBrett asserted there is room for a <tt>std::string_view</tt> like
          type that owns the string data.</li>
      <li>Charles noted that having to pass a string held in such a type to a
          function that requires null termination would require having to copy
          the string contents just to add a null terminator and lamented the
          cost of such copies.</li>
      <li>Jens asked PBrett what other features he might like to see in a new
          string type.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that he would mostly like to not have to write yet
          more string types that avoid null termination concerns.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested that a string type that helps to avoid allocation and
          deallocation costs could be beneficial.</li>
      <li>Jens stated he would prefer not to spend time in SG16 on general
          data structures.</li>
      <li>Jens asserted that the elephant in the room is ICU and the
          functionality it provides and expressed a desire for a roadmap
          towards providing similar functionality.</li>
      <li>Steve suggested that PBrett publish a paper extolling the benefits
          of a string type without null termination.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that benefits appear when working with databases
          and graphics.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that, if a new string type were to materialize, he would
          like to know for sure what encoding it is intended to be used
          with.</li>
      <li>PBrett offered two categories of such encoding assurances:
          1) a type intended for text with an assumed encoding, and
          2) a type that enforces well-formed encoding.</li>
      <li>Steve offered a third category:
          3) a type that maintains invariants like normalization form.</li>
      <li>Steve reported having to investigate problems due to assumption of
          UTF-8 leading to errors when data was passed to Python programs
          that enforced well-formedness.</li>
      <li>Steve stated that Bloomberg is strongly in favor of a type that
          maintains such invariants.</li>
      <li>Charles expressed desire for a way to pass a filename on the command
          line that is preserved.</li>
      <li>Charles explained that this currently isn't possible on Windows due
          to transcoding that occurs when preparing a command line to pass to
          <tt>main()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Tom asked if it is possible to enter such names on the command line
          from Windows shells in the first place, but acknowledged it can be
          done from <tt>CreateProcess()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Charles replied that tab completion and similar shell features can
          produce such names.</li>
      <li>Tom asked to confirm that this should be considered a language issue
          as opposed to a shell issue.</li>
      <li>Charles explained that other languages provide such mechanisms and
          noted that Rust has an <tt>OsString</tt> type that stores WTF-8 on
          Windows.</li>
      <li>PBrett added that Rust is a good example of a language that provides
          strings that don't guarantee null termination.</li>
      <li>Tom returned to discussion about features to focus on and suggested
          Unicode algorithms.</li>
      <li>Hubert asked if ICU provides message formatting features.</li>
      <li>Tom confirmed that it does.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted the work that the Message Format Working Group (MFWG)
          is doing.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: The MFWG tracks its work
          <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg">here</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>Tom suggested improved support for regular expressions as another
          feature to work on.</li>
      <li>Charles replied that such work depends on whether the committee is
          willing to standardize a <tt>std::regex2</tt> or similar.</li>
      <li>Charles stated that a new regex design would presumably face the
          same challenges that <tt>std::regex</tt> did and may therefore
          produce a similarly poor result.</li>
      <li>Charles noted that regular expression support is a feature for which
          interoperability across libraries is not often needed.</li>
      <li>PBrett asserted that a standard regex facility is beneficial because
          general programmers aren't particularly good at writing their
          own.</li>
      <li>Charles suggested that a class intended to be used as a base class
          for string buffer management could be beneficial for building
          parsers; particularly a type that provides interfaces to peek ahead
          and push back.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested a <tt>std::lexy</tt> with reference to
          Jonathan Müller's work.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: Jonathan's Lexy work is published
          <a href="https://lexy.foonathan.net">here</a>. ]</em></li>
      <li>Tom asked if the work done on <tt>std::format</tt> provides a
          precedent for how to design a <tt>std::regex</tt> replacement that
          would be more isolated from ABI concerns.</li>
      <li>Charles responded that <tt>std::format</tt> is fairly exposed to ABI
          concerns, but acknowledged the possibility of designing a more
          isolated type.</li>
      <li>Victor stated that Hana Dusíková's CTRE provides a good example of
          how to write parsers.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: Hana's CTRE work is published
          <a href="https://compile-time-regular-expressions.readthedocs.io/en/latest">here</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>PBrett asked about ideas for how to be more explicit about
          associating an encoding with existing text; e.g., how to have text
          in UTF-8 and pass it to something that requires UTF-16.</li>
      <li>Steve asked if anyone recalled a proposal that would allow
          specifically binding to a string literal.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that he did not but noted that a user-defined literal
          (UDL) can provide similar functionality.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: Tom was thinking of something like this:</em>
<pre style="display:inline"><tt>
  #include &lt;cstddef&gt;
  class string_literal {
  private:
      const char *p;
      string_literal(const char *p) : p(p) {}
  public:
      const char* data() const { return p; }
      friend string_literal operator ""sl(const char *p, std::size_t);
  };
  string_literal operator ""sl(const char *p, std::size_t) {
      return string_literal(p);
  }
  void f(const char*);
  void g(string_literal sl) {
      f(sl.data());
  }
  void h() {
      g("hello"sl);
  }
</tt></pre>
        <em>]</em></li>
      <li>Steve stated that a facility that allows associating a dynamic
          encoding would be useful for scenarios in which the text and its
          associated encoding are not known at compile time.</li>
      <li>Victor noted that encodings are often properties of interfaces and
          suggested that an attribute based approach to specifying encoding
          expecations could be helpful; this would allow specifying
          expectations that are dependent on locale or Windows Active Code
          Page (ACP).</li>
      <li>Charles expressed support for that approach.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked what the advantage of an attribute would be.</li>
      <li>Victor replied that it could be added to existing functions without
          ABI impact.</li>
      <li>Charles observed that, if the <tt>#embed</tt> is adopted, then text
          that is not in the literal encoding might be imported.</li>
      <li>Hubert responded that the <tt>#embed</tt> author has been clear that
          the proposal is intended to provide binary resources.</li>
      <li>Tom changed topics by asking for suggestions regarding how to solicit
          new SG16 attendees and reported that he and Peter had previously
          discussed inviting other WG21 members to share what the organizations
          they work with do in practice.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that backward compatibility and existing practice
          are motivation for not providing new facilities.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested that, if someone were to come forward with a
          proposal to adopt a suite of string types similar to those provided
          by Rust, that we might tell them no thank you.</li>
      <li>PBrett stated that we should, of course, discuss any proposals that
          come before us.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that seems to argue for the status quo plus what people
          actually do.</li>
      <li>Jens expressed belief that there is good opportunity to make progress
          with small improvements and provided a UTF-8 decoding iterator as an
          example.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that an existing proposal covers such iterators.</li>

          ]</em></li>
      <li>Charles responded that he has written a grapheme iterator.</li>
      <li>Charles noted that such iterators are always going to be slower than
          bulk conversion routines.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested adding locale-independent replacements for character
          classification functions like <tt>isdigit()</tt>; e.g.,
          <tt>is_ascii_digit()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Charles expressed support for such locale invariant functions and
          noted via chat that glib provides such a variant named
          <tt>g_ascii_isdigit()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that there is a distinction; locale-independent variants
          would operate using an implementation-defined encoding where as ASCII
          variants would operate using ASCII even in an EBCDIC environment.</li>
      <li>Hubert asked if anyone would object to having both variants; e.g., a
          locale-independent variant that always operates using the "C" locale
          and an ASCII variant.</li>
      <li>No objections were raised.</li>
      <li>PBrett stated that the highest priority item should be transcoding
          facilities.</li>
      <li>Jens asked if he meant something like <tt>iconv()</tt>.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that he meant something more like JeanHeyd Meneide's
          <tt>ztd::text</tt>.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: JeanHeyd's <tt>ztd::text</tt> work is published
          <a href="https://ztdtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest">here</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>Charles stated that, with regard to providing an ICU interface in
          the standard, there are performance implications; support for generic
          iterators would warrant availability of definitions for inlining
          purposes.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked if anyone could comment regarding the utility of
          <tt>std::message</tt>.</li>
      <li>Steve responded that the main problem with message catalogs is that
          they don't tend to work well with real languages.</li>
      <li>PBrett reported having good experience with GNU gettext, but that it
          required discipline to be used successfully.</li>
      <li>PBrett stated that the other elephant in the room is locale, but
          noted that <tt>std::format()</tt> provides a foundation we can build
          on.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested the possibility of enabling thread-specific locale
          facilities that avoid reliance on a global locale.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested a review of all locale dependent interfaces followed
          by a proposal that adds variants that accept a locale as an
          argument.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that C already does that and that all C++ interfaces use
          <tt>std::locale</tt>.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that POSIX provides a thread aware locale interface
          that enables changing locale for a specific thread as well as
          interfaces that accept a locale argument.</li>
      <li>PBrett provided an example; a <tt>std::isalpha()</tt> overload that
          accepts a <tt>std::locale</tt> argument.</li>
      <li>Hubert responded that POSIX specifies a <tt>isalpha_l()</tt>
          interface that accepts a <tt>locale_t</tt> argument.</li>
      <li>Tom asked if <tt>std::locale</tt> is fundamentally problematic or
          whether the problems we face with it are isolated to the facets.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that it has fundamental limitations due to reliance
          on inheritance.</li>
      <li>Victor stated that the facet's assumption that characters fit in a
          code unit is the most significant problem.</li>
      <li>Victor added that <tt>std::locale</tt> uses reference counting and
          therefore has a performance profile similar to a shared pointer.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that <tt>std::locale</tt> strongly ties C++
          implementations to the suite of C locales since the interface depends
          on the names of C locales; it is therefore questionable how
          implementors might provide more generic locale support.</li>
      <li>Steve stated that WG14 recently adopted a proposal that adds
          '@', '$', and '`' to the basic source character set.</li>
      <li>Steve added that he intends to bring a matching paper to WG21 in the
          near future.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: The adopted WG14 proposal is

<h1 id="2022_03_09">March 9th, 2022</h1>

<h2>Draft agenda:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>ICU features to consider for C++26</li>
</ul>

<h2>Attendees:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Charlie Barto</li>
  <li>Hubert Tong</li>
  <li>Jens Maurer</li>
  <li>Peter Brett</li>
  <li>Steve Downey</li>
  <li>Tom Honermann</li>
</ul>

<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Tom introduced the topic:
    <ul>
      <li>Tom was inspired by Jens' assertion during the previous telecon that
          "the elephant in the room is ICU and the functionality it
          provides".</li>
      <li>Based on that, Tom created a
          <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f-CLhYZIf_L0q1QBEqe2sVHyAofGx8Akt_xJKDGhcgA/edit?usp=sharing">Google Doc</a>
          containing a list of ICU feature categories annotated with Tom's
          opinions on whether such features are worthy of consideration for
          standardization in C++26 should suitable proposals materialize.</li>
      <li>Tom would like to issue a Call for Papers covering the features we
          agree are worth consideration.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tom began reviewing the feature categories in the order they appear in
      the document.</li>
  <li>The categories enumerated below are those for which there were material
      comments.</li>
  <li>"Unicode character properties":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom pondered the benefits of exposing the set of raw UCD properties
          as opposed to just those that are needed for other features.</li>
      <li>Charles responded that there are representation choices to be made
          based on usage.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that support for segmentation requires many of the UCD
          properties.</li>
      <li>Steve stated that it would be useful to expose all of the properties
          to enable experimentation.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that, if there are design problems with how the data is
          exposed, that would be useful information.</li>
      <li>PBrett observed that the UCD properties are needed to implement
          proper internationalization and localization support.</li>
      <li>PBrett pondered whether exposing all UCD properties might create
          portability issues.</li>
      <li>Tom asked if it might be reasonable to only expose properties with
          stability guarantees.</li>
      <li>Steve replied that doing so probably would not be viable; some
          properties required for segmentation are not stable and there is a
          need to be able to fix things.</li>
      <li>Tom noted the difference between data being stable as compared to
          property shapes being stable.</li>
      <li>Steve acknowledged and noted that property shapes haven't changed
          in a while.</li>
      <li>Steve added that the ICU maintainers would presumably push back hard
          if Unicode made significant changes to the shape of existing
          properties.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Sets of Unicode Code Points and Strings":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom commented that the items in this category appear to be simple
          utilities.</li>
      <li>PBrett opined that may be a good reason to provide them.</li>
      <li>Tom observed that they appear to be used to provide support for
          character classes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Locales":
    <ul>
      <li>PBrett stated that one of the challenges with locale identifiers is
          that choice of locale is not fixed at compile-time.</li>
      <li>PBrett added that locale IDs are subject to geopolitical changes.</li>
      <li>Steve reported that there has been much work on client-side
          localization through
          <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-402/">ECMA 402</a>,
          and
          <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x">ICU4X</a>.</li>
      <li>Steve expressed caution over trying to standardize something like
          ECMA 401 and ICU4X given that they are recent developments.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that client side support uses browser based
          facilities.</li>
      <li>PBrett wondered if C++ code compiled to WASM should transparently
          proxy to the local environment.</li>
      <li>Tom asked whether new locale support could be built on
          <tt>std::locale</tt>, perhaps via new facets.</li>
      <li>Hubert objected to such support built on new <tt>std::locale</tt>
          facets due to <tt>std::locale</tt> being dependent on C locale
          names.</li>
      <li>PBrett replied that it would be useful to be able to get an ISO
          locale name from a standard locale.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that encoding information would be lost in that
          case.</li>
      <li>PBrett agreed and asserted that encoding ideally wouldn't be a
          locale concern anyway.</li>
      <li>Hubert replied that a particular script could be implied by
          <tt>std::locale</tt>.</li>
      <li>Steve observed that we seem to be in agreement that we don't know
          how to do this today.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that the problem is that proper case mapping, case
          folding, and collation can't be provided without proper locale
          support.</li>
      <li>PBrett agreed and asserted the need for a plan to improve locale
          support.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Resource Bundles":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom suggested that this feature could be built on top of features
          like <tt>#embed</tt> and support for dynamic libraries; perhaps a
          downstream feature then.</li>
      <li>Charles noted that Microsoft style resource management can be
          provided on other platforms using linker scripts.</li>
      <li>PBrett opined that resources are a requirement for a good locale
          system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Calendars and Time Zones" and "Date and Time Formatting":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom stated that base facilities exist that could be expanded, but
          that there are locale dependenices.</li>
      <li>PBrett acknowledged concerns raised by Corentin on the mailing list
          that noted that the existing facilities are not at parity with the
          ICU features.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Message Formatting":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom stated that this is awaiting further developments from the
          <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg">Message Format Working Group (MFWG)</a>.</li>
      <li>PBrett commented that, what programmers want and what they need are
          not always the same thing.</li>
      <li>Charles expressed a desire for experience outside the standard before
          pursuing support in the standard; even more so for this feature than
          for other ones.</li>
      <li>Charles added that, ideally, a production quality application would
          be built on top of such a facility; one that has users using it from
          multiple locales.</li>
      <li>PBrett opined that <tt>std::format()</tt> may not provide a great
          base to build this on.</li>
      <li>Charles replied that it is probably usable, but not sufficient as
          is.</li>
      <li>Tom stated there would presumably be a need to pass a message ID in
          place of a format string.</li>
      <li>Charles reported that could be done using
          <tt>std::vformat()</tt>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Text Transformation":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom suggested that, if there is a specific transliteration that we
          have motivation to provide, then we can do so; range adapters
          provide general support for this otherwise.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that JeanHeyd's
          <a href="https://ztdtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest">ztd.text</a>
          library can do some of this.</li>
      <li>Hubert asked if this feature category is referring to technical
          transliteration or linguistic transliteration.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that he did not know.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Bidirectional Algorithm":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom asked for confirmation that this does not have locale
          dependencies and is effectively about state management for layout
          purposes.</li>
      <li>Steve replied that the algorithm is complicated as it tries to
          support all possible scenarios.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Collation":
    <ul>
      <li>Jens described a design possibility involving locale independent
          base functionality that operates on a set of locale dependent
          collation rules.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that the rules engine would have to be sufficient to
          perform all tasks required by all locales.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that such a facility could be useful as a building block
          for locale support and as a standalone facility.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"String Searching":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom noted the locale dependence.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted collation dependence.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that precise requirements are needed and that basic
          element searching is present.</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested this might be provided by a regular expression
          facility.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Text Boundary Analysis":
    <ul>
      <li>Steve stated there are natural range interfaces for this and that the
          interface is probably clear.</li>
      <li>Hubert asked when a C++ programmer would use this.</li>
      <li>Steve replied that he performs such analysis for reflowing text in
          outgoing email.</li>
      <li>PBrett added that such support was an integral part of a DSP language
          he worked on.</li>
      <li>Steve stated that word wrapping comes up in many scenarios.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Regular Expressions":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom suggested we consider this category if a paper arrives.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that a proposed design would be locale dependent and would
          presumably have to operate on various string types, potentially
          including segmented text data structures.</li>
      <li>PBrett pondered the possibility of a run-time only library with a
          narrow interface that could later be overloaded for new
          extensions.</li>
      <li>Steve stated that this is not an area of his experties but that he
          would be willing to help author a paper if a good design were to
          be proposed.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that there are many SG16 and LEWG related issues to
          consider.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"StringPrep":
    <ul>
      <li>Hubert stated that this feature is related to string normalization
          for interchange purposes such as key lookup.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that the
          <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3454">stringprep RFC</a>
          specifies exclusion of certain characters and expressed a desire to
          better understand what this facility is used for.</li>
      <li>Tom updated the Google Doc to change the consideration column value
          from "N/A" to "No", to add a reference to RFC 3454, and to note that
          this is a string normalization feature.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"IDNA":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom expressed considerable ignorance of this topic.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: "IDNA" stands for
          "Internationalizing Domain Names for Applications" and is covered by
          <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr46">UTS #46</a>. ]</em></li>
      <li>PBrett suggested such support might be needed for standard
          networking.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Universal Time Scale":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom suggested this is not an SG16 concern and could be tackled
          directly by LEWG if motivated.</li>
      <li>Tom updated the Google Doc to change the consideration column value
          from "N/A" to "No; LEWG".</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Paragraph Layout / Complex Text Layout":
    <ul>
      <li>Review of the ICU <tt>playout.h</tt> header revealed that this is an
          experimental facility.</li>
      <li>Tom updated the Google Doc to change the consideration column value
          from "Not yet" to "No" and added a note about the facility being
          experimental.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"ICU I/O":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom stated this is not an SG16 concern.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tom stated that the next telecon is scheduled for 3/23; the agenda is
      TBD.</li>

<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p2558">P2558R0: Add @, $, and ` to the basic character set</a>
    <ul>
      <li>PBrett asked whether this proposal is an SG16 concern.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that we are the encoding experts and best equipped within
          the committee to evaluate whether these changes will have consequences
          for source character sets used in practice; our affirmation of the
          proposal will hopefully ease progress through other groups.</li>
      <li>Charlie asked for confirmation that SG22 will review the paper as
          well.</li>
      <li>Steve replied affirmatively and stated WG14 has already adopted the
          proposal for C.</li>
      <li>Someone (apologies, the editor neglected to record who) noted the
          existence of
          <a href="https://wg21.link/p2342">P2342: For a Few Punctuators More</a>
          and that it argues that these characters could be used as new
          operators.</li>
      <li>Tom responded that P2342 is an example of a paper that is not an SG16
          concern; once the characters are available in the source character
          set, how they are used is an EWG concern.</li>
      <li>Hubert observed that this introduces a requirement that these
          characters be encoded as a single code unit.</li>
      <li>Jens acknowledged and noted that this is required by
          <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.charset#6">[lex.charset]p6</a>
          for all characters in the basic literal character set.</li>
      <li>Jens requested that the paper prose discuss this requirement.</li>
      <li>Steve agreed to add such prose.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that he does not know if this requirement would be
          problematic for any existing character sets.</li>
      <li>Steve replied that there are infrequently used EBCDIC code pages
          that lack them.</li>
      <li>Jens asked if those code pages also lack other characters.</li>
      <li>Steve responded that they probably do.</li>
      <li>Charlie asked if those problematic EBCDIC code pages have unused
          code points that could be used for these characters.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested that digraphs could be introduced to support those
          code pages if needed.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that digraphs can't be used inside character or string
          literals.</li>
      <li>Steve suggested this concern can be addressed if these characters
          start getting used within the standard.</li>
      <li>Jens reported that the addition of these characters to the basic
          character set makes them ineligible to be specified via a
          <em>universal-character-name</em> (UCN) outside of a character or
          string literal due to
          <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.charset#3">[lex.charset]p3</a>.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested that restriction could be lifted.</li>
      <li>Charlie stated that existing uses of '$' are probably limited to
          identifiers and symbol renaming via attributes, pragma directives,
          or <tt>asm</tt> labels.</li>
      <li>Hubert reported they may appear in preprocessor stringization.</li>
      <li>PBrett reported they may appear in header names as well.</li>
      <li>Jens noticed that use of a UCN to <tt>#include</tt> a source file
          named with one of these characters would become ill-formed.</li>
      <li>PBrett reiterated support for lifting restrictions on use of UCNs
          to name characters from the basic character set with the rationale
          that we shouldn't ban things that are only bad ideas.</li>
      <li>Charlie stated that, if such incompatibilities were to cause
          problems in practice, then lifting that restriction would be the
          obvious solution.</li>
      <li>Steve suggested such concerns can be addressed after the paper is
          approved; we know programmers want to use these characters.</li>
      <li>Tom asked Steve if he knows whether the UCN concern was discussed
          in WG14.</li>
      <li>Steve replied that it was not.</li>
      <li>Hubert asked when UCNs are translated in identifiers and other
          preprocessor tokens.</li>
      <li>Jens replied, during translation phase 3 except in quoted contexts;
          so translation occurs as a <em>preprocessing-token</em> is
          formed.</li>
      <li>PBrett observed that the new UCN restrictions would be limited to
          <em>h-char</em> and <em>q-char</em> sequences since these characters
          aren't otherwise usable outside quoted contexts.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that they may also appear in a
          <em>preprocessing-token</em> used in stringization.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that a UCN specifying one of these characters would
          become ill-formed during stringization.</li>
      <li>Hubert added that, likewise, use of a UCN to specify '$' in an
          identfier would become ill-formed.</li>
      <li>Tom asked whether that matters since use of '$' in an identifier is
          already an extension.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that these characters currently match the
          "each non-whitespace character that cannot be one of the above"
          case of
          <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.pptoken#nt:preprocessing-token"><em>preprocessing-token</em></a>.</li>
      <li>Jens requested that this discussion be included in the paper.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked whether <em>h-char</em> and <em>q-char</em> sequences
          remain a backward compatibility concern.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that they do, but that UCNs in such sequneces already
          have implementation-defined behavior; what UCNs mean in
          <em>h-char</em> and <em>q-char</em> sequences isn't really
          defined.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: Per
          <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.phases#1.3">[lex.phases]p1.3</a>,
          UCNs are not recognized and replaced in <em>h-char-sequence</em> and
          <em>q-char-sequence</em> sequences and, per
          <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.header#1">[lex.header]p1</a>,
          these sequences are mapped in an implementation-defined manner.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>Tom suggested that it might be worth updating the paper to describe
          how existing implementations behave with respect to UCNs in
          preprocessor token concatenation, stringization and <tt>#include</tt>
          scenarios.</li>
      <li>Jens asked if there are other ways in which these characters might
          plausibly be used today.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that Objective-C uses '@'.</li>
      <li>Jens mentioned the possibility of concerns being raised regarding
          the imposition of single code unit encoding for these characters on
          the execution character set.</li>
      <li>Tom asked Hubert if he was aware of any EBCDIC related concerns.</li>
      <li>Hubert replied that his colleagues in WG14 did not express such
          concerns and that he is confident that they would have if they had
          any.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that locales that don't support these characters would
          no longer be strictly conforming but could still be supported as
          extensions.</li>
      <li>Tom summarized the discussion; there are requests to Steve to update
          the prose for several of the items discussed, but that there do not
          appear to be any objections to the paper direction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://rawcdn.githack.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings/c84e3e4eef341795fb9ac44824525a3a89583fa7/presentations/2022-04-13-d2572r0.html">D2572R0: std::format() fill character allowances</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Tom provided an overview of the topic and prior discussions.</li>
      <li>Tom asked for additional categories of characters that should be
          represented in the introductory table.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that Zero-Width Joiner (ZWJ) and
          Zero-Width Non-Joiner (ZWNJ) cases were not added because he thought
          they were not interesting.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that lone surrogates should not be possible.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested the bidirectional override characters.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: the bidirectional override characters are
           U+2066 through U+202E. ]</em></li>
      <li>Tom agreed to add right-to-left and left-to-right examples.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that extending fill character support to arbitrary
          extended grapheme clusters (EGCs) in the future would presumably
          impose an ABI break.</li>
      <li>Mark agreed that it would; at least one implementation only stores
          a single code unit as the current wording appears to specify.</li>
      <li>Charlie agreed and noted that another implementation stores the fill
          character as a code unit sequence with a maximum length of 4 code
          units for UTF-8.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that, for the "Estimated display width restrictions"
          section, there is no good or right solution.</li>
      <li>Tom asked if characters with an estimated width other than one were
          to be banned, how that would be accomplished without imposing
          undesirable overhead.</li>
      <li>PBindels noted that the ZWSP case is interesting; if it were given
          an estimated-width of 0, then an infinite amount of padding would be
          required.</li>
      <li>Charlie stated that the estimated width is not intended to be
          accurate; it is best effort.</li>
      <li>Charlie stated that, in the "Existing practice" section,
          <tt>std::format_error</tt> is now thrown for the cases that
          previously produced the stack overflow for MSVC.</li>
      <li>Charlie noted that the diagnostic is somewhat disappointing though
          since an invalid type is reported because the intended fill
          character does not match the <tt>fill-and-align</tt> grammar.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: The diagnostic produced by gcc with {fmt} is
          likewise disappointing. ]</em></li>
      <li>PBrett suggested that a table that demonstrates the desired output
          inline with the proposal would be useful.</li>
      <li>Victor stated that the paper direction makes sense and is consistent
          with previous guidance.</li>
      <li>Victor pondered the consequences of diagnosing fill characters with
          an estimated width other than one; on one hand, it would be nice,
          but on the other hand, it adds overhead and potentially restricts
          valid use cases.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested that fill characters with an estimated width other
          than one could be conditionally supported.</li>
      <li>PBrett stated that his preferred approach would be to diagnose at
          run-time (e.g., throw an exception) when alignment requirements
          could not be achieved due to the estimated width of the fill
          character.</li>
      <li>PBindels reviewed the "Proposal" section and stated:
        <ul>
          <li>The first point to restrict to a single UCS scalar value seems
              sensible.</li>
          <li>The third and fourth points appear to be consistent with what
              implementations currently do.</li>
          <li>The second point is the questionable one.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>PBrett suggested that the number of fill characters inserted could
          be unspecified when the fill character has an estimated width other
          than one.</li>
      <li>PBindels replied that he considered that as well, but since the
          actual width is dependent on font selection, a consistent result may
          not be achieved anyway.</li>
      <li>Charlie reminded the group that the estimated widths are not
          currently specified by any standard.</li>
      <li>Charlie observed that diagnosing fill characters with an estimated
          width other than one will have the potential effect of rendering
          existing code invalid if estimated widths are changed in the
          future.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested another possibility that, if the fill character has
          an estimated width of two, then perform the alignment as if the fill
          character and all characters in the format argument have an estimated
          width of one; this would enable idiographic characters to be
          formatted properly.</li>
      <li>Charlie responded that, if such a feature is desirable, then it would
          be preferable to add a flag to opt-in to it rather than inferring it
          based on the chosen fill character.</li>
      <li>Tom agreed and noted that idiographic characters are just one special
          case.</li>
      <li>Charlie stated that, for table style alignment, it is likely
          preferrable to emit a field separator character explicitly in the
          format string rather than to rely on the fill and align
          capabilities.</li>
      <li>PBindels asserted that there is value to having well-defined portable
          behavior across implementations, so unspecified and
          implementation-defined behaviors should be avoided where
          possible.</li>
      <li>Hubert asked if Victor has good examples of this facility being used
          with format arguments that have characters with estimated widths
          other than one regardless of fill character.</li>
      <li>Victor replied affirmatively, but stated he did not recall specific
          examples; such cases involved terminal output.</li>
      <li>Tom reported vague recollections of such examples being present in
          Victor's original papers.</li>
      <li>PBrett stated that support for certain languages remains a concern
          for him and reported seeing Japanese characters reliably displayed in
          terminals in tabular formats.</li>
      <li>Tom asked if he knew how the programmers were facilitating such
          output.</li>
      <li>PBrett replied that he did not.</li>
      <li>PBindels asked if it would be feasible to research what features
          would be useful for such languages.</li>
      <li>PBrett replied that it isn't feasible for him to do so due to the
          number of possible solutions; he would like to allow implementations
          to be creative and see what the results bring.</li>
      <li>PBindels again emphasized a desire for portable behavior.</li>
      <li>Charlie agreed and stated that a creative solution in one
          implementation might produce an error in another.</li>
      <li>Tom asked Peter Brett if it would suffice for an implementation to
          provide a flag to opt-in to an alternate behavior.</li>
      <li>PBrett lamented the absence of attendees that are experts in
          non-Latin based languages.</li>
      <li>Hubert questioned the frequency with which a programmer would want
          to use a fill character with an estimated width other than one;
          the programmer would presumably need to be able to specify a
          fill-remainder character or otherwise provide their own padding.</li>
      <li>Victor agreed with the goal of specifying consistent behavior and
          suggested standardizing the demonstrated existing behavior in which
          a fill character is assumed to have an estimated width of one.</li>
      <li>Charlie noted that a programmer can implement their own fancy
          formatter that produces a result that is then embedded using
          standard formatters.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that it sounds like we have a few possible extension
          mechanisms that can be used for experimentation, work arounds, or
          future standard behavior.</li>
      <li>Tom reported that he is leaning towards Victor's suggestion of
          specifying the currently demonstrated implementation experience.</li>
      <li>PBindels indicated he would be content with any of the demonstrated
          outputs so long as behavior is consistent across implementations.</li>
      <li>PBrett expressed concern about specifying particular behavior in the
          absence of more diverse expertise in SG16.</li>
      <li>PBindels stated that he would reach out within his organization to
          try to find people with more diverse experience that would be
          interested in attending.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tom reported that the next meeting will be on 2022-04-27.</li>

      <li>PBrett provided an introduction.</li>
      <li>Victor explained that LWG reviewed the wording and conditionally
          approved the paper subject to SG16 review.</li>
      <li>PBrett recalled concerns raised in the past regarding the use of
          Unicode properties.</li>
      <li>Victor replied that implementors were present during the LWG review
          and did not express any objections or concerns.</li>
      <li>Victor noted that Hubert provided some wording tweaks during the
          LWG review.</li>
      <li>PBrett presented wording updates Tom
          <a href="https://lists.isocpp.org/sg16/2022/04/3111.php">proposed on the SG16 mailing list</a>.</li>
      <li>PBrett expressed a preference for Tom's wording relative to the
          current wording.</li>
      <li>Victor stated that he is ok with Tom's wording so long as it is
          equivalent to the current wording in the paper for the Unicode
          case.</li>
      <li>Victor stated that he would prefer not to defer to other format
          facilities for the description of how hexadecimal values are
          formatted.</li>
      <li>Hubert expressed a desire to document spacing and non-printable
          characters by their encoded values as opposed to their character
          names or glyphs.</li>
      <li>Hubert explained that doing so would free the library from having
          to be aware of the literal encoding selected at compile-time.</li>
      <li>Tom acknowledged the concern; the set of spacing and non-printable
          characters, or their encoded values may differ for one literal
          encoding vs another.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that the concern applies to both EBCDIC and Windows
          code pages.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that the proposed wording could produce strange
          results in cases where unnecessary shift states are present.</li>
      <li>PBrett observed that the current wording does not state which
          encoding is used in cases where printable characters overlap with
          control characters in a related encoding, but the proposed wording
          does.</li>
      <li>Jens noticed that the proposed wording states that the literal
          encoding is used to construct <em>E</em>, but not to interpret
          <em>S</em>.</li>
      <li>Tom acknowledged the omission and stated that it needs to be
          corrected.</li>
      <li>PBrett returned to his example where a locale encoding overlays
          graphical characters over control characters and noted that the
          overlayed characters would be interpreted in the literal
          encoding.</li>
      <li>Hubert reported that his implementations are not affected by
          overlay concerns and that locale support can be added later if
          motivated.</li>
      <li>Zach asked if the method for determining whether <em>S</em> is in a
          Unicode encoding matches the method specified for
          <tt>std::format()</tt> in C++20.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that he didn't recall how it was specified.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: It does not appear to be specified. The relevant
          wording simply states "For a string in a Unicode encoding, ...". See
          <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/format#string.std-11">[format.string.std]p11</a>,
          <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/format#string.std-12">[format.string.std]p12</a>,
          and
          <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/format#string.std-14">[format.string.std]p14</a>.
          Improvements appear to be warranted. ]</em></li>
      <li>Jens stated that, with the exception of the use of <em>CE</em> for
          string <em>S</em>, this is well-specified so long as it matches the
          desired behavior.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that <tt>std::format()</tt> is intentionally locale
          independent.</li>
      <li>Hubert reported that his implementations will likely assume a certain
          literal encoding rather than storing the literal encoding actually
          used at compile-time; that encoding is likely to be EBCDIC 1047 or,
          for ASCII contexts, ISO-8859-1.</li>
      <li>Hubert expressed his understanding of the design intent to be that an
          escaped sequence can be interpreted to reproduce the original byte
          sequence.</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested that it may be worth adding a note to that
          effect.</li>
      <li>Tom acknowledged the intent and noted that his wording fails to
          reflect that intent for stateful encodings since state transitions in
          <em>S</em> should be reflected as escape sequences rather than
          interpreted when constructing <em>E</em>.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked for other concerns.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that there is the issue of handling boundaries of ill-formed
          code unit sequences and asked if anyone wanted to argue for addressing
          that now.</li>
      <li>PBrett expressed a preference not to address it now.</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested it could be unspecified or
          implementation-defined.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that it is more-or-less implied at present.</li>
      <li>PBrett agreed.</li>
      <li>Tom summarized the discussion; we agree that we want revised wording
          for this case but that we don't quite have what we want yet.</li>
      <li>Tom said he will inform LWG that we'll continue iterating on the
          wording with the intent to have something approved by our next
          meeting in two weeks.</li>
      <li>Hubert agreed with the summary.</li>
      <li>Victor gave a thumbs up.</li>

          the telecon. The agenda and links used here reference P2558R1 since
          the links to the draft paper were ephemeral. The published document
          may differ from the reviewed draft revision. ]</em></li>
      <li>Steve reported that the prose was updated to record the results of
          prior discussions in order to better explain the intent; the wording
          has not been changed.</li>
      <li>Steve presented the paper and noted that section 3 is new.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested adding a comment in
          section 3.1 (Universal Character Name)
          to indicate the character corresponding to <tt>\u0060</tt>.</li>
      <li>PBrett reported a typo in
          section 3.4, "sting literal" should be "string literal".</li>
      <li>PBrett noted that, with respect to existing use of these characters,
          they are usually used for convenience where another mechanism could
          be used.</li>
      <li>Steve agreed and noted that such use generally occurs in contexts
          that require some kind of magic and where they can generally be
          escaped in some way.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that, with regard to raw string literals, a reason to
          exclude the new characters in the delimiter portion is because these
          characters might acquire meaning in the future that could become
          problematic.</li>
      <li>Tom expressed a preference to exclude <tt>`</tt> for now so that we
          can preserve it for use as a new type of string literal.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: Such exclusion is unnecessary; the raw string
          literal delimiter pattern is bounded by a double quote and a
          parenthesis. Allowing use of <tt>`</tt> in between those poses no
          ambiguity for a hypothetical new string literal delimited by
          <tt>`</tt>. ]</em></li>
      <li>Tom suggested the paper explicitly note that the proposed changes
          enable these characters to portably be used in character literals
          by virtue of being encoded as a single code unit.</li>
      <li>Steve agreed to update the paper.</li>
      <li>PBrett reported another typo in
          section 3.3, "invarient" should be "invariant".</li>
      <li>Jens expressed a continuing interest in the paper showing examples
          of behavioral changes.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that such examples should be added to annex C.</li>
      <li>Steve reported two known compatibility issues:
        <ul>
          <li>Use of a UCN to name one of these characters in
              stringification.</li>
          <li>Use of a UCN to name one of these characters as an argument to
              a function-like macro that does not use the corresponding
              parameter.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Steve suggested it may suffice to forward an updated paper via an

  </li>
  <li>Tom stated that the next meeting will be May 11th and will hopefully

      <li><em>[ Editor's note: D2286R8 was the active paper under discussion at
          the telecon. The agenda and links used here reference P2286R8 since
          the links to the draft paper were ephemeral.  The published document
          may differ from the reviewed draft revision. ]</em></li>
      <li>Victor summarized recent wording changes worked out on the SG16
          mailing list.</li>
      <li>Victor asked if "code point" should be preferred over "character" in
          the proposed wording for [format.string.escaped]p2.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that he is unaware of any normative use of "code point"
          in the standard today.</li>
      <li>Victor responded that it is used in the wording for format field
          width estimation.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that the usage there is in a Unicode specific context
          and that "character" is probably most appropriate here.</li>
      <li>Hubert pointed out that, in [format.string.escaped]p2.3, it is odd
          that <em>c</em> is defined as a character, but then compared with
          UCS scalar values.</li>
      <li>Jens agreed and proposed substituting "character" for
          "UCS scalar value" in paragraph 2.3.1 and in the header of the
          associated table.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested doing likewise in paragraph 2.3.3.</li>
      <li>Hubert argued that a change is not needed in 2.3.3 due to the use of
          "corresponds".</li>
      <li>Tom noted the use in that paragraph is also a Unicode specific
          context.</li>
      <li>Tom asked Charles if he continues to have concerns regarding the lack
          of specification for determining the boundaries of ill-formed code
          unit sequences.</li>
      <li>Charles replied that he does and that he would like to see it
          addressed via a reference to the
          <a href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org">WHATWG Encoding Standard</a>.</li>
      <li>Tom responded with uncertainty whether such a normative reference is
          possible given the lack of versioning around that standard.</li>
      <li>Charles suggested that the method specified in the WHATWG standard
          could be replicated in the C++ standard; we want the "maximal subpart"
          behavior described by policy option 2 in
          <a href="http://unicode.org/review/pr-121.html">Unicode PR-121</a>.</li>
      <li>Hubert asked if that policy is defined for all UTF encodings.</li>
      <li>Charles replied that it is.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked what the motivation is for rigorously specifying how the
          boundaries of ill-formed code unit sequences are determined.</li>
      <li>Charles replied that the goal is to ensure consistent output, but then
          noticed that, in this case, the method used does not appear to be
          observable since each code unit of the sequence is written to the
          output anyway.</li>
      <li>Tom agreed that it should not matter for self-synchronizing
          encodings.</li>
      <li>Charles noted that this will be the first instance of Unicode UCD
          properties being normatively required by the C++ standard.</li>
      <li>Charles suggested that, if we're ok with such normative use, we could
          revisit the wording for estimated format field widths to make the
          uses there normative as well.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note:
          <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/format.string.std#11">[format.string.std]p11</a>
          specifies normative encouragement of behavior that depends on UCD
          properties in order to identify extended grapheme cluster boundaries.
          ]</em></li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: This would not be the first normative use of the
          UCD properties;
          <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.name#1">[lex.name]p1</a>
          requires the <tt>XID_Start</tt> and <tt>XID_Continue</tt> properties
          to determine identifier boundaries and validity. ]</em></li>
      <li>Jens requested that such changes not be handled via this paper.</li>
      <li>Steve asked how much data is required for the new uses of the
          <tt>General_Category</tt> and <tt>Grapheme_Extend</tt>
          properties.</li>
      <li>Victor replied that the necessary data fits in ~1K.</li>
      <li>Charles agreed and shared a
          <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/main/stl/inc/__msvc_format_ucd_tables.hpp">link to code</a>
          used to implement a grapheme break algorithm that uses the
          <tt>Grapheme_Cluster_Break</tt> and <tt>Extended_Pictographic</tt>
          properties.</li>
      <li>Charles noted that some creative packing is necessary to get the
          size that small.</li>
      <li>Tom expressed surprise that <tt>Grapheme_Extend</tt> is small.</li>
      <li>Victor replied that it is composed of a number of compressable
          ranges.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: The set of all characters that satisfy the

<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In honor of a new attendee, a round of introductions was conducted.</li>
  <li><a href="https://rawcdn.githack.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings/ad0a0ed160ef6216954c699ba5b8497190eaf29c/presentations/2022-05-25-d2572r0.html">D2572R0: std::format() fill character allowances</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Tom presented the paper.</li>
      <li>Robin pointed out a spelling error; "IDIOGRAPHIC" -&gt; "IDEOGRAPHIC"
          (two occurrences).</li>
      <li>Charlie explained that the ABI mitigation technique discussed in the
          "Future considerations and ABI" section relies on persistence of at
          least the fill character portion of the format string but such
          persistence is not otherwise currently required because the format
          string is evaluated at compile-time.</li>
      <li>Charlie stated he could imagine ways of accomplishing the goal
          though.</li>
      <li>Tom asked for confirmation that the Microsoft implementation is
          already shipping and locked into its current ABI.</li>
      <li>Charlie confirmed that is the case.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that he would add a note to the ABI section stating that
          some implementations are already locked in to their current
          behavior.</li>
      <li>Steve commented that there are escape hatches and that other
          extension means are possible should the need arise.</li>
      <li>Charlie explained why implementing ABI resiliency would likely impose
          dynamic memory management costs including possible lifetime
          management challenges.</li>
      <li>Jens reported finding it a bit concerning that the estimated width of
          a character would be honored in some cases but not in others, but
          recognized the trade offs involved.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that boilerplate wording is needed within the format
          section in order for the proposed use of "U+007B LEFT CURLY BRACKET"
          and "U+007D RIGHT CURLY BRACKET" to be applicable to the literal
          encoding.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that the proposed wording changes to table 64 need work;
          in "if that value is negative", it is not clear whether "value"
          refers to "<em>n</em>" or to
          "the width of the formatting argument".</li>
      <li>Jens requested that "estimated" be inserted before "width" in
          "the width of the formatting argument".</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that "formatting argument" doesn't sound like the right
          term in this context; it should probably be "formatted argument".</li>
      <li>Tom reported that this term was used for consistency with wording
          elsewhere but that he would review and try to improve.</li>
      <li>Jens requested that the note following table 64 be modified to
          replace "ignored" with "assumed to be 1".</li>
      <li>Tom agreed.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Tom provided a brief introduction.</li>
      <li>Hubert asked if it is necessary to address the UAX31-R3 conformance
          concern for C++23.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that he did not believe so since the annex is
          non-normative.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: Zoom crashed for Tom and it took him several
          minutes to get reconnected.
          Jens assured him that the time missed primarily concerned the
          flogging of a dead horse. ]</em></li>
      <li>Jens asked what version of Unicode is expected to receive the
          proposed amendments.</li>
      <li>Robin replied that Unicode 15 is expected to have these updates and
          that more significant normative changes are anticipated for
          Unicode 16.</li>
      <li>Robin stated that Unicode 15 is expected to be released in
          September.</li>
      <li>Jens observed that September would be just in time for adoption in
          C++23.</li>
      <li>Steve suggested that the annex could be updated to claim
          non-conformance with UAX31-R3.</li>
      <li>Hubert agreed and noted that we may not want to change our dated
          UAX31 reference at that late point in the C++23 release cycle.</li>
      <li>Jens proposed that we proceed with an NB comment on the C++23
          committee draft to request upgrading the bibliography reference for
          UAX31 to Unicode 15.</li>
      <li>Jens explained that, since the new Unicode release won't be available
          before then, it won't be possible to act on a core issue and an NB
          comment would end up being required anyway.</li>
      <li>Robin directed discussion to allowances for
          U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK (LRM) and U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK (RLM)
          to be used in combination with other whitespace.</li>
      <li>Robin stated that example wording can be found in the
          Ada 2012 reference manual;
          <a href="http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/rm12_w_tc1/html/RM-2-2.html#p7.1">section 2.2 paragraph 7 1/3, "Lexical Elements, Separators, and Delimiters"</a>
          states:
          <div style="padding: .5em; background: #E9FBE9">
          One or more other_format characters are allowed anywhere that a
          separator is; any such characters have no effect on the meaning of
          an Ada program.
          </div>
      </li>
      <li>Jens noted that this would be a new kind of whitespace for C++ since
          sequences of these marks by themselves would not constitute
          whitespace.</li>
      <li>Jens expressed curiosity regarding "implicit directional marks" as
          discussed in L2/22-072R.</li>
      <li>Robin replied that "implicit directional marks" is discussed in
          <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr9/#Implicit_Directional_Marks">UAX #9 section 2.6, "Implicit Directional Marks"</a>.</li>
      <li>Robin explained that, per
          <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr9/#Conversion_to_Plain_Text">UAX #9 section 6.5, "Conversion to Plain Text"</a>,
          such marks may be implicitly inserted during conversion to plain text
          for text subject to protocol
          <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr9/#HL4">UAX9-HL4</a>
          and that Unicode 15 will recommend that protocol for source code
          text.</li>
      <li>Hubert asked if it would make sense to prohibit sequences consisting
          of more than one of these marks.</li>
      <li>Robin replied that he knew of no motivation for doing so; that the
          presence of multiple marks should not pose any negative
          consequences.</li>
      <li>Jens expressed opposition to these marks constituting whitespace
          separation in isolation.</li>
      <li>Tom agreed.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that specification of LRM and RLM in whitespace will have
          to target C++26 as C++23 is now closed to new language changes.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested that such a change could be adopted as a DR against
          C++23 to encourage recognition of these marks as a conforming
          extension in prior language modes.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that a paper will be needed and that it should await the
          availability of Unicode 15.</li>
      <li>Tom stated he would file a SG16 github issue to track the request for
          such a paper.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: Tom filed
          <a href="https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16/issues/74">SG16 issue 74: Extend whitespace to include NEL, LS, PS, LRM, RLM, and maybe ALM</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>Tom noted that this isn't a particularly urgent issue to address.</li>
      <li>Jens countered that it would be helpful to prevent obfuscated display
          of source code and that the desire to avoid such confusion has gained
          prominence in recent times.</li>
      <li>Jens directed discussion towards future conformance with UAX31-R3 and
          that there are questions about <tt>Pattern_White_Space</tt> that need
          to be answered.</li>
      <li>Robin asked which <tt>Pattern_White_Space</tt> characters are not
          considered whitespace in C++.</li>
      <li>Hubert listed them; they are all the ones outside the ASCII subset.
        <ul>
          <li>U+0085 NEXT LINE</li>
          <li>U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK</li>
          <li>U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK</li>
          <li>U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR</li>
          <li>U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Hubert noted that the above characters can only appear in comments and
          character or string literals currently.</li>
      <li>Jens asked if it is the intent of UAX31-R3 to require that all of the
          characters in <tt>Pattern_White_Space</tt> be supported as
          whitespace.</li>
      <li>Robin replied that allowing a subset would render the requirement
          vacuous.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested the possibility of updating UAX31-R3 to specify a
          minimal subset.</li>
      <li>Robin responded that a sub-requirement like UAX31-R3a could be
          introduced; such sub-requirements can be found elsewhere in
          UAX #31.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that the current normative text of UAX31-R3 allows
          deviation by specifying a profile.</li>
      <li>Hubert asked what motivation exists for not accepting the other
          whitespace characters.</li>
      <li>Steve noted existing practice and suggested this be addressed in the
          future paper.</li>
      <li>Jens directed discussion to conformance with the
          <tt>Pattern_Syntax</tt> requirement of UAX31-R3.</li>
      <li>Robin expressed a belief that C++ conforms to that.</li>
      <li>Tom expressed curiosity with regard to the presence of <tt>.</tt> in
          <tt>Pattern_Syntax</tt> and its use within floating point
          literals.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: Tom's concern stems from the following note in
          the description of UAX31-R3. Is the use of <tt>.</tt> in
          floating point literals considered syntax or part of a literal?</em>
          <div style="padding: .5em; background: #E9FBE9">
          <b>Note:</b> When meeting this requirement, all characters except
          those that have the Pattern_White_Space or Pattern_Syntax properties
          are available for use as identifiers or literals.
          </div>
          <em>]</em>
      </li>
      <li>Hubert stated that this kind of confusion is why he is hesitant to
          declare conformance to UAX31-R3 prior to improved wording that will
          hopefully appear in Unicode 16.</li>
      <li>Jens summarized the three tasks identified so far:
        <ul>
          <li>For C++23, file an NB comment after the July plenary to update
              <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/uaxid.pattern">[uaxid.pattern]</a>
              in annex E to state that conformance with UAX31-R3 is not claimed.
              At the same time, update the UAX references in the bibliography
              to refer to Unicode 15.</li>
          <li>For C++26, author a paper to add LRM, RLM, and other
              <tt>Pattern_White_Space</tt> characters to the set of whitespace
              characters.
              If support for U+061C ARABIC LETTER MARK is also desired, that
              will require a profile to conform with UAX31-R3.</li>
          <li>For C++26, update
              <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/uaxid.pattern">[uaxid.pattern]</a>
              in annex E to claim conformance with UAX31-R3.
              At the same time, update the UAX references in the bibliography
              to refer to Unicode 16 (or later).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Robin noted that Unicode 15 is planned for release on September 13th
          per
          <a href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/beta-15.0.0.html">https://www.unicode.org/versions/beta-15.0.0.html</a>.</li>
      <li>Tom recalled Hubert mentioning on the mailing list that
          U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) can now be added to the basic character
          set.</li>
      <li>Hubert acknowledged and opined that we can do so as part of
          <a href="https://wg21.link/p2348">P2348: Whitespaces Wording Revamp</a>.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that CR presumably should have already been present
          because of the existence of the <tt>\r</tt> escape sequence.</li>
      <li>Jens explained that <tt>\r</tt> creates a requirement for literal
          encodings but not for the basic character set nor an allowance for
          its use in whitespace.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that a paper will be needed that targets SG15 and discusses
          the concerns and options available to implementations with regard to
          UAX9-HL4 and presentation of source code that contains right-to-left
          characters.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: Tom filed
          <a href="https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16/issues/75">SG16 issue 75: SG15 proposal for implementations that present source code to conform with UAX9-HL4</a>
          to track producing such a paper. ]</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tom stated that the next meeting will be in two weeks, on 2022-06-08.</li>
</ul>

    <ul>
      <li>PBrett lamented the lack of a published revision with a "P"
          designation and change history that reflects the evolution of the
          design and wording.</li>
      <li>Tom stated, in response to preferences expressed by Victor on the
          mailing list, that he will add a drafting note regarding the change
          of "specifier" to "option" in the description of the <em>align</em>
          grammar production so that LWG will be sure to review.</li>
      <li>Jens requested that the drafting note regarding note renumbering be
          removed since the LaTeX machinery will handle that automatically.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that he would add a note following the format examples
          that mentions that the clown face emoji has an estimated length of
          two.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested adding an example with a formatting argument that
          contains a character with an estimated width other than one;
          essentially an example that swaps the fill character and formatting
          argument in example <tt>s7</tt>.</li>
      <li>Jens requested that note X be modified to drop "estimated" and to
          replace "width of the fill character" with "width of <b>any</b>
          fill character".</li>
      <li>Jens expressed distaste for the existing wording in
          <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/format.string.std#11">[format.string.std]p11</a>
          that states "estimated width of ... UCS scalar values";
          UCS scalar values are not characters.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted a missing "the" in the same paragraph;
          "the sum of <b>the</b> estimated widths".</li>
      <li><b>Poll 1: Revise D2572R0 "std::format() fill character allowances"
             as discussed, and forward the paper so revised to LEWG as the

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Discuss survey questions to suggest for the 2023 C++ Developer Survey
    <ul>
      <li>PBrett proposed separating the survey questions into two categories:
        <ul>
          <li>The form of the source code; how the source code is written.</li>
          <li>The facilities used to perform text processing.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>PBrett suggested that questions about tools might comprise an
          additional category.</li>
      <li>Inbal suggested asking for input on what topics most urgently require
          solutions in the standard.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that a free form question could be used for that and that
          the current developer survey presents such free form responses as a
          word cloud.</li>
      <li>PBrett asserted that the questions should address the topics we most
          want to learn about.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested asking what facilities programmers are using in
          place of standard facilities like <tt>std::regex</tt> and
          <tt>std::locale</tt> that are known to have significant design
          issues.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that the standard notion of locale encompasses both
          interface and locale identification; a programmer may use
          <tt>std::locale</tt> or the C locale facilities for locale
          identification, but then use alternate facilities for locale dependent
          behavior.</li>
      <li>PBrett pondered whether the facilities programmers actively use to
          support internationalization and localization is one of the topics we
          are most ignorant of.</li>
      <li>Hubert responded that there is speculation that programmers avoid the
          standard facilities but that we don't have data to confirm that.</li>
      <li>Steve stated that Bloomberg actively avoids the standard locale
          related facilities.</li>
      <li>Victor suggested it might be helpful to ask if programmers are
          intentionally using the standard locale facilities and noted that many
          do so inadvertently.</li>
      <li>Victor noted that the questions need to consider C and C++ locale
          facilities as distinct facilities.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested structuring the questions as:
        <ul>
          <li>"Do you provide internationalization support", and</li>
          <li>"If so, how do you provide internationalization support".</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Victor stated that those questions should include multiple selection
          responses that include C, C++, POSIX, etc...</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested adding ICU and other popular packages.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked for additional topics that we might be particularly
          ignorant about.</li>
      <li>Steve suggested asking if programmers are still having to work with
          multiple character encodings within their main application and, if so:
        <ul>
          <li>whether they transcode at application boundaries and work
              exclusively with Unicode internally, or</li>
          <li>whether they work directly with data in whatever character
              encoding it is provided in.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>PBrett suggested it would be useful to know how often programmers
          use regular expressions where the pattern is not known until
          run-time.</li>
      <li>Victor pondered whether Hana coerced Peter to ask that question.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that she did not, but that the question does concern
          whether and to what extent CTRE is a suitable substitute for
          <tt>std::regex</tt>.</li>
      <li>Steve agreed that it would be useful to understand what the
          requirements for a replacement are.</li>
      <li>Charlie stated that a replacement would need to be more ABI resilient
          but that there is no need to pass compiled regular expression objects
          across module boundaries.</li>
      <li>Steve suggested asking which regular expression languages programmers
          are using.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that question requires an "I don't know" response
          option.</li>
      <li>Tom asked if it would be helpful to know how many programmers are
          using <tt>TCHAR</tt> in Windows environments.</li>
      <li>Charlie reported suspicion that many programmers are still using
          that.</li>
      <li>Tom wondered what we might do with such data if we had it.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested it would be interesting to know what libraries
          programmers are using for Unicode algorithm support and string
          classes.</li>
      <li>Tom asserted that that question would need to be multiple choice with
          an "other" option.</li>
      <li>Tom recalled one of the questions Peter had suggested on the mailing
          list, "what language(s) do you use in identifiers and comments?", and
          asked whether the question was intended to probe the languages used or
          whether characters outside the basic character set are being
          used.</li>
      <li>PBrett replied that the interest is in the language; the goal is to
          find out which scripts are being used.</li>
      <li>Tom recalled one of the questions Zach suggested,
          "How often do you use multiple Unicode normalization forms in the
          same program?" and commented that this is similar to the encoding
          question; whether programmers normalize at program boundaries or not
          normalize at all.</li>
      <li>Steve stated this is an important consideration for deciding if
          normalization belongs in the type system.</li>
      <li>Tom mentioned that Zach also posed questions about collation
          support.</li>
      <li>Steve replied that collation needs depend on context; data in a
          database is likely to be ordered in a locale independent manner but
          may need to be reordered for presentation in a user's locale.</li>
      <li>Inbal asked if serialization is within the purview of SG16.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that it could be for producing and consuming text
          formats.</li>
      <li>Inbal stated that, given a list of keywords, it would be possible to
          scrape stackoverflow.com for related questions.</li>
      <li>Tom wondered about asking if programmers place locale constraints on
          their users; for example, whether they require use of UTF-8.</li>
      <li>Hubert responded that such a question won't garner a 100% yes answer,
          so may not be so helpful.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that it might be useful to help guide where we invest
          effort; if lots of products support non-UTF-8 environments, then we
          know to focus more broadly.</li>
      <li>Hubert agreed with that perspective.</li>
      <li>PBrett stated that a transcoding facility remains high on our
          priority list and asked if the question about internal encodings and
          translation at program boundaries was intended to probe actual
          need.</li>
      <li>Tom responded that he had not thought about that relationship
          concretely.</li>
      <li>Steve suggested that question is more related to how many programmers
          need to operate directly on text in multiple encodings and if
          facilities are needed to do so.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that gathering interest in a rope class would be
          useful.</li>
      <li>Tom asked if that would be for the case of stringing together blocks
          of text that are differently encoded.</li>
      <li>Hubert responded affirmatively.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted such a type is also useful in cases where buffers are in
          different places.</li>
      <li>Tom pondered what we would do with data regarding which character
          types are in use; for example, whether we would choose not to focus
          on <tt>char32_t</tt> as anything other than a code point type.</li>
      <li>Steve suggested asking if programmers use <tt>signed char</tt> and
          <tt>unsigned char</tt> for text as opposed to for use as small
          integers like <tt>int8_t</tt> and <tt>uint8_t</tt> or for other forms
          of bit manipulation.</li>
      <li>Hubert responded that <tt>unsigned char</tt> is likely used for
          UTF-8.</li>
      <li>Victor responded that <tt>unsigned char</tt> is often used for
          <tt>uint8_t</tt> and that this causes formatting confusion.</li>
      <li>Inbal asked if C and C++ compatibility is important.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that it is helpful to decide if we need low level C
          utilities that are exposed via C++ wrappers.</li>
      <li>Tom added that JeanHeyd has been pursuing the approach of getting low
          level facilities for transcoding through WG14 before continuing work
          on transcoding support in WG21.</li>
      <li>PBrett raised the question of which kind of C string interfaces are
          important; null terminated vs Pascal strings.</li>
      <li>PBrett mentioned WG14 Annex K and noted that Microsoft can't ship it
          due to conflicts with their historical secure function
          implementation.</li>
      <li>Hubert returned to the topic of localization and stated it would be
          useful to know if programmers customize locale formatting or just
          rely on default formatting.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that he will draft a Google doc with an initial set of
          questions based on this discussion that we can all comment on and
          contribute to.</li>
      <li>Further discussion ensued regarding stability vs the need to evolve
          and fix defects.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tom stated that the next meeting will be on 2022-06-22 and that, if we
      make good progress refining and suggesting survey questions in the
      interim, then we'll probably continue this discussion then.</li>
</ul>
