<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A round of introductions was held to welcome Fraser as a new
      attendee.</li>
  <li>Planning for Issaquah:
    <ul>
      <li>Tom expressed interest in holding a meeting in Issaquah despite
          neither he nor Peter Brett planning to attend in person.</li>
      <li>Tom reported that Steve agreed to facilitate the in-person aspects
          of the meeting in Issaquah.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested aiming for a half day on Thursday.</li>
      <li>Tom asked who planned to attend in person; three people expressed
          such intent.</li>
      <li>MarkZ reported that he would have a conflict at 3pm every day.</li>
      <li>Discussion ensued regarding the merits of reserving a room vs
          planning for in-person attendees to join via Zoom.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that Zach's recent and upcoming papers may attract more
          interest.</li>
      <li>Zach noted that SG16 tends to attract a few additional attendees
          beyond the regulars.</li>
      <li>Tom stated he would request a room.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p2736r0">P2736R0: Referencing the Unicode Standard</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>Tom summarized the discussion from the
          <a href="https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings#december-14th-2022">2022-12-14 SG16 telecon</a>
          concerning the <tt>__STDC_ISO_10646__</tt> predefined macro.</li>
      <li>Corentin provided an introduction.</li>
      <li>Corentin reported having reviewed the terminology from the Unicode
          Standard to identify wording changes to be made.</li>
      <li>Corentin explained that ISO/IEC 10646 uses "character" in its wording,
          but that the proposed wording uses "abstract character" when
          appropriate.</li>
      <li>Corentin noted that "character" is retained for uses such as
          "character type".</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that the "abstract character" definition from the
          Unicode Standard can be broadly applied and thus should only be used
          when a broad interpretation is actually intended.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied that "abstract character" is relevant when mapping
          between different character sets.</li>
      <li>Corentin indicated that "abstract character" only ended up being used
          in one place.</li>
      <li>Jens asserted there is a need for a term to express equivalence
          between characters.</li>
      <li>Tom agreed and noted that "abstract character" is useful when there
          is more than one possible encoding for the same character;
          as in Unicode normalization forms.</li>
      <li>Hubert acknowledged that "abstract character" would be appropriate
          for the mapping of source code characters to the translation
          character set.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested that is a QoI concern since translation phase 1
          behavior is implementation-defined.</li>
      <li>Hubert agreed use of the term could be avoided there if desired.</li>
      <li>Corentin explained that the C++ standard currently contains two
          normative references to ISO/IEC 10646, one of which is to an
          obsolecent version for a definition of UCS-2; the proposed wording
          replaces references to UCS-2 with a restricted form of UTF-16.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that references to the Unicode Standard are inclusive
          of the annexes; normative references to the annexes are therefore
          removed.</li>
      <li>Corentin reported that many of the changes are mechanical;
          "UCS" was replaced with "Unicode".</li>
      <li>Corentin noted that the control code alias names table was removed
          following discussion on the SG16 mailing list.</li>
      <li>Steve pondered whether notes should be added to the C++ standard that
          explain where to find information in the Unicode Standard.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied that doing so can be useful;
          for example for <tt>NameAliases.txt</tt>.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that "UCS Encoding Form" is more restrictive than
          "Unicode Encoding Form"; the latter isn't limited to the common UTF
          encodings..</li>
      <li>Mark asked if that terminology should not then be changed.</li>
      <li>Hubert replied that it might be necessary to add constraints or to
          find another way to identify the relevant encodings.</li>
      <li>Mark suggested that the first heading in Table 1 in [lex.charset]
          could be changed to "abstract character".</li>
      <li>Jens objected and explained that the first column lists code points
          and the second column lists names; these are concrete character
          references.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied that he had not felt a need to change the use of
          "character" in that table heading.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that the change to remove the control code alias table
          changes the specification with regard to allowances for the "BELL"
          and "ALERT" names.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied that wording was added to restrict alias names to
          those that are specified as
          "control", "correction", and "alternate".</li>
      <li>Jens noted that the code page chart appears to list "BELL" as a
          control name, but in a confusing way that is inconsistent with the
          names in <tt>NameAliases.txt</tt>.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: The discussion of "BELL" and "ALERT" centers
          around how the Unicode Standard presents the alias names for U+0007.
          The
          <a href="https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf">C0 Controls and Basic Latin PDF</a>
          displays as follows.
          <blockquote class="quote">
<pre>0007  &lt;control&gt;
             = BELL</pre>
          </blockquote>
          <a href="https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/NameAliases.txt"><tt>NameAliases.txt</tt></a>
          is more clear in its intent:
          <blockquote class="quote">
<pre># Note that no formal name alias for the ISO 6429 "BELL" is
# provided for U+0007, because of the existing name collision
# with U+1F514 BELL.

0007;ALERT;control
0007;BEL;abbreviation</pre>
          </blockquote>
          ]</em></li>
      <li>Tom summarized the concern; implementors might look at the code page
          charts and become confused or implement something other than what is
          intended.</li>
      <li>Corentiin replied with doubts that implementors would base their
          implementations on the code page charts.</li>
      <li>Zach asked if the intent can be made more explicit by reintroducing a
          note to direct readers to <tt>NameAliases.txt</tt>.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that a note would be helpful and that be believes the
          existing table was originally built from content in
          <tt>NameAliases.txt</tt>.</li>
      <li>Steve suggested amending the proposed
          "control, correction, or alternate" wording to add
          "as specified in <tt>NameAliases.txt</tt>".</li>
      <li>Jens expressed concern about duplicating content from the Unicode
          Standard.</li>
      <li>Zach suggested retaining the prior
          "These names are derived from the Unicode Character Database's
          <tt>NameAliases.txt</tt>" wording but with "derived" removed.</li>
      <li>Corentin agreed to make a change.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that references to the Unicode Standard should have
          "the" capitalized.</li>
      <li>Tom expressed a preference in favor of "Unicode code point" over
          "Unicode scalar value" with the latter reserved for use in
          expressing requirements.</li>
      <li>Zach expressed indifference and noted that UCD properties won't be
          present for surrogate code points.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that use of "Unicode scalar value" has the advantage
          of avoiding the question of whether non-scalar values need to be
          considered in the given context.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that "Unicode scalar value" implies a precondition that,
          if violated, could lead to undefined behavior.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested that references to chapters of the Unicode Standard
          should use both numbers and names for resiliency against changes.</li>
      <li>Corentin explained that references to UCS-2 were replaced with
          references to UTF-16 with additional restrictions to limit encoded
          characters to those in the BMP.</li>
      <li>Fraser replied that there is a semantic difference since UCS-2 allowed
          encoding surrogate code points.</li>
      <li>Corentin responded that the previous wording was not clear how such
          code points were to be handled.</li>
      <li>Hubert pointed out that, in the proposed wording for the
          <tt>codecvt</tt> facets, the first bullet describes the artifacts
          produced by an encoding where as the second bullet names an
          encoding.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that both bullets should be written such that they can be
          easily read as specifying encodings.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested retaining UCS-2 teminology by adding a definition of
          it that specifies it as a restricted form of UTF-16.</li>
      <li>Zach expressed a preference for the currently proposed wording with
          the category error corrected.</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested that the wording state that the facet only maps
          from that code point range and nothing else.</li>
      <li>Tom observed that, if the UTF-8 text has characters that map outside
          the BMP, the wording doesn't say what happens.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that we need to make it clear that just converting to
          UTF-16 isn't acceptible.</li>
      <li>Corentin explained that he did not remove the UAX #31 reference since
          Steve is working on related changes.</li>
      <li>Corentin expressed uncertainty whether a separate UAX #31 reference
          is needed.</li>
      <li>Corentin observed that some unintended <tt>tcode</tt> LaTeX markup
          appears in one of the bibliography entries proposed for removal.</li>
      <li>Zach returned discussion to the <tt>__STDC_ISO_10646__</tt> predefined
          macro, noted that it is inherited from C, and opined that there is
          nothing to be done for it.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that the wording essentially states that <tt>wchar_t</tt>
          must be at least 21 bits for the macro to be defined.</li>
      <li>Hubert observed that the proposed change loses the requirement that
          storing a wide character stores a value that matches that character's
          Unicode scalar value.</li>
      <li>Hubert explained that this behavior is the design flaw that makes it
          not possible for a compiler to predefine this macro; the value held
          in an object of type <tt>wchar_t</tt> has a locale dependent
          interpretation.</li>
      <li>Zach suggested that restricting the implication to the encoding of
          wide character literals might be an improvement.</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested this might be a matter worth discussing in SG22.</li>
      <li>Zach asked if the wording could just defer to the C standard.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that we can do so for library wording, but not for core
          wording.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that we could match the wording in the C standard.</li>
      <li>Steve noted a misspelling of 10646 in the first paragraph of the
          Motivation section: "10446".</li>

<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A round of introductions was conducted for Nathan; though he had attended
      previous meetings, we had never formally introduced ourselves.</li>
  <li>Planning for NOT Issaquah.
    <ul>
      <li>Tom explained that, due to competing priorities and a shortage of
          conference rooms, the only time slot available was for an evening
          session and, per previous discussion, an evening session time slot
          would be challenging for remote attendees; as a result, SG16 will
          not host an in-person meeting, but Tom is open to hosting another
          telecon next week before Issaquah to continue paper review.</li>
      <li>Zach agreed with meeting next week, but argued that an in-person
          meeting in Issaquah should still be held.</li>
      <li>PBrett opined that there would be few attendees.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that a number of people that will have opinions on
          his papers will be present in Issaquah.</li>
      <li>Corentin asserted we should plan to meet in Varna.</li>
      <li>PBrett stated that Zach's
          <a href="https://wg21.link/p2728r0">P2728R0: Unicode in the Library, Part 1: UTF Transcoding</a>
          and
          <a href="https://wg21.link/p2729r0">P2729R0: Unicode in the Library, Part 2: Normalization</a>
          require SG16 review from an interface perspective.</li>
      <li>Tom agreed with Peter.</li>
      <li>Steve suggested that it would be useful to get early feedback from
          LEWG for Zach's papers.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that we don't want to spend months in review and then
          have LEWG question the design later.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that we should ensure people are aware that these
          papers target C++26 and that time slots will be available in Varna
          and later meetings.</li>
      <li>Steve agreed that we should not host an official SG16 meeting in
          Issaquah.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that we will proceed with a telecon next week and no
          meeting in Issaquah.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p2736r0">P2736R0: Referencing the Unicode Standard</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>Corentin explained the changes made, as suggested by Jens, to provide
          a definition for UCS-2 as needed for <tt>std::codecvt_utf8</tt> and
          <tt>std::codecvt_utf16</tt>.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that the UCS-2 definition is specified in terms of
          scalar values so as to exclude lone surrogates.</li>
      <li>Corentin noted that the previous wording did not address how lone
          surrogates were to be handled.</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested moving where "only" appears in the UCS-2
          wording.</li>
      <li>Corentin reported that various grammar and spelling issues pointed
          out by Jens were corrected.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that the prior discussion of the
          <tt>__STDC_ISO_10646__</tt> predefined macro was inconclusive.</li>
      <li>Hubert recalled a suggestion to treat this macro the same as
          <tt>__STDC_VERSION__</tt>.</li>
      <li>Fraser asked if <tt>__STDC_ISO_10646__</tt> could be removed from the
          C++ standard and noted that implementations could still define it
          since it is a reserved identifier.</li>
      <li>Corentin expressed reluctance to doing so as part of this paper since
          this paper is not intended to make design changes.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that he plans to work with SG22 and WG14 regarding the
          intended use of the macro.</li>
      <li>Corentin asserted that a minimal change suffices for now to remove the
          reliance on ISO/IEC 10646.</li>
      <li>Hubert replied that the proposed change isn't the minimal solution
          since it diverges from the C standard.</li>
      <li>Hubert clarified that the suggestion wasn't to reference the C
          standard, but rather to leave the definition rather meaningless so
          that implementors lean on C for meaning.</li>
      <li>Corentin asked if the suggestion was to just make the macro
          implemenation-defined.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that he thought that was what Fraser had suggested.</li>
      <li>Fraser confirmed.</li>
      <li>Jens asserted that the wording should preserve the condition that the
          macro, if defined, has a value with a particular syntactical
          form.</li>

      <li>Hubert noted some existing occurrences of "Unicode encoding" in the

      <li>Corentin reported that he did not see a reason to update that

      <li>Hubert stated that the relevant encodings should be restricted to

      <li>Corentin provided an introduction:
        <ul>
          <li>The wording substitutes "Unicode scalar value" for "character"
              in many places, but retains the latter in some contexts.</li>
          <li>This removes the "translation character set" indirection.</li>
          <li>The changes were mechanically applied.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>PBrett expressed support for the improved specificity.</li>
      <li>Corentin began reviewing the wording changes.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that Jens had previously requested an overview of the final
          state we are driving towards with these kinds of changes.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied that the motivation section addresses some of those
          concerns.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that he finds the proposed wording confusing since
          "character" ends up getting mixed in with Unicode terminology.</li>
      <li>Corentin explained that he has concerns about introducing a lot of
          churn that doesn't help to improve clarity.</li>
      <li>Fraser stated that additional specificity is probably needed to
          clarify which characters constitute new-line and whitespace.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that, with the exception of new-line, that characters are
          specified using Unicode code points.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that
          <a href="https://wg21.link/p2348">P2348 (Whitespaces Wording Revamp)</a>
          is relevant.</li>
      <li>Corentin explained that he intentionally did not modify the
          specification of whitespace in this paper.</li>
      <li>Corentin expressed a desire for agreement on the replacement of
          "elements of the translation character set".</li>
      <li>PBrett noticed an editorial issue in [lex.charset] for
          <em>n-char</em>; the updated wording retains "set" from the intended
          substitution of "Unicode code point" for "member of the translation
          character set".</li>
      <li>Jens observed that a change in [lex.phases] to substitute
          "Unicode scalar value" for
          ".. elements of the translation character set" retains a reference to
          [lex.charset] that no longer makes sense.</li>
      <li>Jens opined that the note in [lex.charset] that describes the
          difference between "code points" and "scalar values" should be
          retained.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that the location of that note is a little odd since it
          doesn't encapsulate the notion of "abstract character".</li>
      <li>Hubert observed that the updates to [lex.phases]p3 only updated one of
          the two uses of "space character".</li>
      <li>Corentin asked for opinions regarding a footnote in [lex.name] that
          discusses representation of characters outside the basic character set
          in external identifiers.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that the footnote could use some updates.</li>
      <li>Tom opined that the footnote should just be removed.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that
          <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/implimits#2.6">[implimits]p(2.6)</a>
          does specify a minimum limit for the number of significant characters
          in an external identifier.</li>
      <li>PBrett stated that the the uses of "character" in that annex need to
          be addressed.</li>
      <li>Corentin asked if CWG would be content with the removal of that
          footnote.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that he does not know but that he personally does not see
          value in retaining it; the note probably serviced its value 20 some
          years ago.</li>
      <li>Jens observed that "characters" would have to be interpreted as code
          points for the purposes of the external identifier limit.</li>
      <li>Tom noted the implication that, if UTF-8 was used for the encoding of
          external identifiers, a worst case limit must be assumed such that a
          limit of 1024 code points implies a limit of 4096 code units.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tom reported that SG16 will meet in one week, on 2023-02-01 in order to
      squeeze in one more review of P2749R0 before the WG21 meeting in
      Issaquah.</li>

<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Tom announced that this telecon is SG16's 100th!</li>
  <li>Corentin noted that LEWG is considering hosting an evening session in
      Issaquah to discuss Zach's
      <a href="https://wg21.link/p2728r0">P2728R0: Unicode in the Library, Part 1: UTF Transcoding</a>
      and
      <a href="https://wg21.link/p2729r0">P2729R0: Unicode in the Library, Part 2: Normalization</a>
      papers.</li>
  <li>Steve expressed support for early LEWG review so as to avoid a situation
      in which SG16 forwards a paper with interfaces that LEWG does not approve
      of; such cases have occurred with other study groups.</li>
  <li>PBrett noted that there are sometimes competing perspectives between what
      domain experts value and what LEWG values.</li>
  <li>PBrett acknowledged the possibility that LEWG will approve of Zach's
      design, that SG16 proceeds with making changes during its review, and that
      LEWG finds that it does not approve of the changed direction.</li>

          ]</em></li>
      <li>Tom provided a summary of the last telecon.</li>
      <li>Tom raised two concerns to be addressed.
        <ul>
          <li>Comments that Jens raised in a
              <a href="https://lists.isocpp.org/sg16/2023/01/3693.php">post to the SG16 mailing list</a>.</li>
          <li>Whether the paper should take a dependency on
              <a href="https://wg21.link/p2348">P2348 (Whitespaces Wording Revamp)</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Corentin explained that, with regard to Jens' concern about
          inconsistent use of the "Unicode code point" and "character" terms,
          that the changes made to mechanically replace "character" in 10-20
          pages of wording were quite extensive.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that, in cases where the wording refers to a specific
          character, such as U+0020 SPACE, that the term "character" is
          appropriate.</li>
      <li>Corentin acknowledged Jens' concerns, but noted that the updated
          wording does reduce ambiguity.</li>
      <li>Corentin claimed that the proposal includes a minimal change and that
          additional changes could be done editorially at a later time.</li>
      <li>Tom reported having spent time reviewing the changes and that he found
          the various uses of "Unicode scalar value", "Unicode code point", and
          "character" rather confusing.</li>
      <li>Tom expressed concern that the differences are subtle and that it
          might be unfair to place the project editor in the position of having
          to deal with those differences; at least not without clearly specified
          guidelines.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that the project editor shouldn't make such changes
          since they can have normative impact.</li>
      <li>Corentin reiterated that his goal with the paper is to remove the
          "translation character set" terminology in C++23 to avoid its
          appearance in new teaching materials.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested modifying the paper title to append "in lexing" since
          that better matches the scope of the proposed changes.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested reviewing the wording to ensure consistent terminology
          use.</li>
      <li>The group started reviewing the changes to [lex.phases].</li>
      <li>PBrett noted that people complain about the Unicode terms, but that
          their use is well justified in an international standard.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted the use of "character" in association with new-line and
          asked whether new-line could consist of multiple code points.</li>
      <li>Tom responded that, since the translation input is now specified in
          terms of Unicode code points, that we can define exactly what a
          new-line character is.</li>
      <li>Hubert agreed and stated that would provide a better basis for
          defining whitespace.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that <tt>\n</tt> can have platform impact in some contexts
          but that it doesn't in lexing.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied that more significant changes would be required to
          substitute U+000A LINE FEED for "new-line character" and that there
          would still be remaining uses of "character".</li>
      <li>PBrett stated it could be a conscious choice to leave those cases to a
          later paper like P2348.</li>
      <li>Hubert responded that the motivation for asking for additional work is
          to avoid increasing internal friction within the standard wording as
          the paper does now.</li>
      <li>Corentin expressed concern regarding incorporating work from P2348 due
          to concerns CWG had with that paper.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that, in lexing context, specifying new-line is not
          observable.</li>
      <li>Fraser asked if new-line characters are observable in raw string
          literals.</li>
      <li>Hubert replied negatively and explained that, in a raw string literal,
          new-line is mapped to <tt>\n</tt> in the execution character set.</li>
      <li>Steve stated issues with that were fixed.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that there are related CWG issues.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: See
          <a href="https://wg21.link/cwg1655">CWG issue 1655 (Line endings in raw string literals)</a>
          and
          <a href="https://wg21.link/cwg1709">CWG issue 1709 (Stringizing raw string literals containing newline)</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>Corentin pondered whether it is necessary to consider both papers at
          the same time.</li>
      <li>Hubert recommended sending a message to the CWG mailing list to ask
          about that.</li>
      <li>Corentin noted the substitution of a Unicode code point reference in
          place of "backslash character".</li>
      <li>Corentin mentioned that the changes are intended to allow "code point"
          to be used for non-Unicode character sets; hence "Unicode code point"
          is used in contexts specific to Unicode.</li>
      <li>Tom expressed uncertainty about the addition of "abstract" in
          [lex.phases]p1.</li>
      <li>Corentin responded that abstract characters are used to explain
          mapping between character sets.</li>
      <li>Tom agreed, but stated that wording is missing to tie the input to a
          sequence of abstract characters.</li>
      <li>Fraser suggested adding a statement to specify that the lexer
          processes a sequence of Unicode code points.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that the current wording limits the effort required to
          document how input is mapped to a sequence of characters.</li>
      <li>Corentin acknowledged that wording could be added to state that the
          implementation-defined mapping produces a sequence of Unicode scalar
          values.</li>
      <li>Corentin pointed out how "space character" and "whitespace character"
          is used differently in [lex.phases]p3.</li>
      <li>Mark observed that the changes to [lex.phases]p3 substituted
          "multi-Unicode code point" for "multi-character".</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested substituting
          "token comprising multiple Unicode code points" instead.</li>
      <li>Tom expressed support for substituting "U+0020 SPACE character" for
          "space character".</li>
      <li>Corentin observed that "character" can be omitted in the
          substitution.</li>
      <li>Hubert agreed.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested that, in [lex.charset], "code points" could be
          substituted for "characters" in
          "The basic character set is a subset ... consisting of 96 characters".</li>
      <li>Hubert replied that such a substitution would introduce a category
          error; the basic character set is intended to be a set of abstract
          characters and is used as such in some places.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested "The basic character set is a subset of the abstract
          characters included in the Unicode character set".</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested a simpler change;
          "the basic character set consists of the 96 characters specified in [lex.charset.basic]".</li>
      <li>Tom stated that the changes to the note in [lex.charset]p6 should
          state "Unicode code point" instead of just "code point" for
          consistency.</li>
      <li>PBrett opined that, with only 15 minutes remaining, that he did not
          think we'll be ready to forward the paper.</li>
      <li>Tom agreed and stated that he doesn't feel that we have sufficiently
          reviewed the paper to be confident in polling it.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that our goal is not to make a perfect standard, but rather
          to make improvements; we can poll forwarding it knowing that more
          work will be needed.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested polling to continue work and then poll a recommended
          resolution for the related NB comment in C++23.</li>
      <li>Steve asked what the motivation is for getting this change in
          C++23.</li>
      <li>Corentin responded that he is motivated to remove
          "translation character set" before it appears in training
          materials.</li>
