<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A round of introductions was held to welcome Fraser as a new
      attendee.</li>
  <li>Planning for Issaquah:
    <ul>
      <li>Tom expressed interest in holding a meeting in Issaquah despite
          neither he nor Peter Brett planning to attend in person.</li>
      <li>Tom reported that Steve agreed to facilitate the in-person aspects
          of the meeting in Issaquah.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested aiming for a half day on Thursday.</li>
      <li>Tom asked who planned to attend in person; three people expressed
          such intent.</li>
      <li>MarkZ reported that he would have a conflict at 3pm every day.</li>
      <li>Discussion ensued regarding the merits of reserving a room vs
          planning for in-person attendees to join via Zoom.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that Zach's recent and upcoming papers may attract more
          interest.</li>
      <li>Zach noted that SG16 tends to attract a few additional attendees
          beyond the regulars.</li>
      <li>Tom stated he would request a room.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p2736r0">P2736R0: Referencing the Unicode Standard</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>Tom summarized the discussion from the
          <a href="https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings#december-14th-2022">2022-12-14 SG16 telecon</a>
          concerning the <tt>__STDC_ISO_10646__</tt> predefined macro.</li>
      <li>Corentin provided an introduction.</li>
      <li>Corentin reported having reviewed the terminology from the Unicode
          Standard to identify wording changes to be made.</li>
      <li>Corentin explained that ISO/IEC 10646 uses "character" in its wording,
          but that the proposed wording uses "abstract character" when
          appropriate.</li>
      <li>Corentin noted that "character" is retained for uses such as
          "character type".</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that the "abstract character" definition from the
          Unicode Standard can be broadly applied and thus should only be used
          when a broad interpretation is actually intended.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied that "abstract character" is relevant when mapping
          between different character sets.</li>
      <li>Corentin indicated that "abstract character" only ended up being used
          in one place.</li>
      <li>Jens asserted there is a need for a term to express equivalence
          between characters.</li>
      <li>Tom agreed and noted that "abstract character" is useful when there
          is more than one possible encoding for the same character;
          as in Unicode normalization forms.</li>
      <li>Hubert acknowledged that "abstract character" would be appropriate
          for the mapping of source code characters to the translation
          character set.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested that is a QoI concern since translation phase 1
          behavior is implementation-defined.</li>
      <li>Hubert agreed use of the term could be avoided there if desired.</li>
      <li>Corentin explained that the C++ standard currently contains two
          normative references to ISO/IEC 10646, one of which is to an
          obsolecent version for a definition of UCS-2; the proposed wording
          replaces references to UCS-2 with a restricted form of UTF-16.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that references to the Unicode Standard are inclusive
          of the annexes; normative references to the annexes are therefore
          removed.</li>
      <li>Corentin reported that many of the changes are mechanical;
          "UCS" was replaced with "Unicode".</li>
      <li>Corentin noted that the control code alias names table was removed
          following discussion on the SG16 mailing list.</li>
      <li>Steve pondered whether notes should be added to the C++ standard that
          explain where to find information in the Unicode Standard.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied that doing so can be useful;
          for example for <tt>NameAliases.txt</tt>.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that "UCS Encoding Form" is more restrictive than
          "Unicode Encoding Form"; the latter isn't limited to the common UTF
          encodings..</li>
      <li>Mark asked if that terminology should not then be changed.</li>
      <li>Hubert replied that it might be necessary to add constraints or to
          find another way to identify the relevant encodings.</li>
      <li>Mark suggested that the first heading in Table 1 in [lex.charset]
          could be changed to "abstract character".</li>
      <li>Jens objected and explained that the first column lists code points
          and the second column lists names; these are concrete character
          references.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied that he had not felt a need to change the use of
          "character" in that table heading.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that the change to remove the control code alias table
          changes the specification with regard to allowances for the "BELL"
          and "ALERT" names.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied that wording was added to restrict alias names to
          those that are specified as
          "control", "correction", and "alternate".</li>
      <li>Jens noted that the code page chart appears to list "BELL" as a
          control name, but in a confusing way that is inconsistent with the
          names in <tt>NameAliases.txt</tt>.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: The discussion of "BELL" and "ALERT" centers
          around how the Unicode Standard presents the alias names for U+0007.
          The
          <a href="https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf">C0 Controls and Basic Latin PDF</a>
          displays as follows.
          <blockquote class="quote">
<pre>0007  &lt;control&gt;
             = BELL</pre>
          </blockquote>
          <a href="https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/NameAliases.txt"><tt>NameAliases.txt</tt></a>
          is more clear in its intent:
          <blockquote class="quote">
<pre># Note that no formal name alias for the ISO 6429 "BELL" is
# provided for U+0007, because of the existing name collision
# with U+1F514 BELL.

0007;ALERT;control
0007;BEL;abbreviation</pre>
          </blockquote>
          ]</em></li>
      <li>Tom summarized the concern; implementors might look at the code page
          charts and become confused or implement something other than what is
          intended.</li>
      <li>Corentiin replied with doubts that implementors would base their
          implementations on the code page charts.</li>
      <li>Zach asked if the intent can be made more explicit by reintroducing a
          note to direct readers to <tt>NameAliases.txt</tt>.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that a note would be helpful and that be believes the
          existing table was originally built from content in
          <tt>NameAliases.txt</tt>.</li>
      <li>Steve suggested amending the proposed
          "control, correction, or alternate" wording to add
          "as specified in <tt>NameAliases.txt</tt>".</li>
      <li>Jens expressed concern about duplicating content from the Unicode
          Standard.</li>
      <li>Zach suggested retaining the prior
          "These names are derived from the Unicode Character Database's
          <tt>NameAliases.txt</tt>" wording but with "derived" removed.</li>
      <li>Corentin agreed to make a change.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that references to the Unicode Standard should have
          "the" capitalized.</li>
      <li>Tom expressed a preference in favor of "Unicode code point" over
          "Unicode scalar value" with the latter reserved for use in
          expressing requirements.</li>
      <li>Zach expressed indifference and noted that UCD properties won't be
          present for surrogate code points.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that use of "Unicode scalar value" has the advantage
          of avoiding the question of whether non-scalar values need to be
          considered in the given context.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that "Unicode scalar value" implies a precondition that,
          if violated, could lead to undefined behavior.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested that references to chapters of the Unicode Standard
          should use both numbers and names for resiliency against changes.</li>
      <li>Corentin explained that references to UCS-2 were replaced with
          references to UTF-16 with additional restrictions to limit encoded
          characters to those in the BMP.</li>
      <li>Fraser replied that there is a semantic difference since UCS-2 allowed
          encoding surrogate code points.</li>
      <li>Corentin responded that the previous wording was not clear how such
          code points were to be handled.</li>
      <li>Hubert pointed out that, in the proposed wording for the
          <tt>codecvt</tt> facets, the first bullet describes the artifacts
          produced by an encoding where as the second bullet names an
          encoding.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that both bullets should be written such that they can be
          easily read as specifying encodings.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested retaining UCS-2 teminology by adding a definition of
          it that specifies it as a restricted form of UTF-16.</li>
      <li>Zach expressed a preference for the currently proposed wording with
          the category error corrected.</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested that the wording state that the facet only maps
          from that code point range and nothing else.</li>
      <li>Tom observed that, if the UTF-8 text has characters that map outside
          the BMP, the wording doesn't say what happens.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that we need to make it clear that just converting to
          UTF-16 isn't acceptible.</li>
      <li>Corentin explained that he did not remove the UAX #31 reference since
          Steve is working on related changes.</li>
      <li>Corentin expressed uncertainty whether a separate UAX #31 reference
          is needed.</li>
      <li>Corentin observed that some unintended <tt>tcode</tt> LaTeX markup
          appears in one of the bibliography entries proposed for removal.</li>
      <li>Zach returned discussion to the <tt>__STDC_ISO_10646__</tt> predefined
          macro, noted that it is inherited from C, and opined that there is
          nothing to be done for it.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that the wording essentially states that <tt>wchar_t</tt>
          must be at least 21 bits for the macro to be defined.</li>
      <li>Hubert observed that the proposed change loses the requirement that
          storing a wide character stores a value that matches that character's
          Unicode scalar value.</li>
      <li>Hubert explained that this behavior is the design flaw that makes it
          not possible for a compiler to predefine this macro; the value held
          in an object of type <tt>wchar_t</tt> has a locale dependent
          interpretation.</li>
      <li>Zach suggested that restricting the implication to the encoding of
          wide character literals might be an improvement.</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested this might be a matter worth discussing in SG22.</li>
      <li>Zach asked if the wording could just defer to the C standard.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that we can do so for library wording, but not for core
          wording.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that we could match the wording in the C standard.</li>
      <li>Steve noted a misspelling of 10646 in the first paragraph of the
          Motivation section: "10446".</li>

<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A round of introductions was conducted for Nathan; though he had attended
      previous meetings, we had never formally introduced ourselves.</li>
  <li>Planning for NOT Issaquah.
    <ul>
      <li>Tom explained that, due to competing priorities and a shortage of
          conference rooms, the only time slot available was for an evening
          session and, per previous discussion, an evening session time slot
          would be challenging for remote attendees; as a result, SG16 will
          not host an in-person meeting, but Tom is open to hosting another
          telecon next week before Issaquah to continue paper review.</li>
      <li>Zach agreed with meeting next week, but argued that an in-person
          meeting in Issaquah should still be held.</li>
      <li>PBrett opined that there would be few attendees.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that a number of people that will have opinions on
          his papers will be present in Issaquah.</li>
      <li>Corentin asserted we should plan to meet in Varna.</li>
      <li>PBrett stated that Zach's
          <a href="https://wg21.link/p2728r0">P2728R0: Unicode in the Library, Part 1: UTF Transcoding</a>
          and
          <a href="https://wg21.link/p2729r0">P2729R0: Unicode in the Library, Part 2: Normalization</a>
          require SG16 review from an interface perspective.</li>
      <li>Tom agreed with Peter.</li>
      <li>Steve suggested that it would be useful to get early feedback from
          LEWG for Zach's papers.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that we don't want to spend months in review and then
          have LEWG question the design later.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that we should ensure people are aware that these
          papers target C++26 and that time slots will be available in Varna
          and later meetings.</li>
      <li>Steve agreed that we should not host an official SG16 meeting in
          Issaquah.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that we will proceed with a telecon next week and no
          meeting in Issaquah.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p2736r0">P2736R0: Referencing the Unicode Standard</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>Corentin explained the changes made, as suggested by Jens, to provide
          a definition for UCS-2 as needed for <tt>std::codecvt_utf8</tt> and
          <tt>std::codecvt_utf16</tt>.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that the UCS-2 definition is specified in terms of
          scalar values so as to exclude lone surrogates.</li>
      <li>Corentin noted that the previous wording did not address how lone
          surrogates were to be handled.</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested moving where "only" appears in the UCS-2
          wording.</li>
      <li>Corentin reported that various grammar and spelling issues pointed
          out by Jens were corrected.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that the prior discussion of the
          <tt>__STDC_ISO_10646__</tt> predefined macro was inconclusive.</li>
      <li>Hubert recalled a suggestion to treat this macro the same as
          <tt>__STDC_VERSION__</tt>.</li>
      <li>Fraser asked if <tt>__STDC_ISO_10646__</tt> could be removed from the
          C++ standard and noted that implementations could still define it
          since it is a reserved identifier.</li>
      <li>Corentin expressed reluctance to doing so as part of this paper since
          this paper is not intended to make design changes.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that he plans to work with SG22 and WG14 regarding the
          intended use of the macro.</li>
      <li>Corentin asserted that a minimal change suffices for now to remove the
          reliance on ISO/IEC 10646.</li>
      <li>Hubert replied that the proposed change isn't the minimal solution
          since it diverges from the C standard.</li>
      <li>Hubert clarified that the suggestion wasn't to reference the C
          standard, but rather to leave the definition rather meaningless so
          that implementors lean on C for meaning.</li>
      <li>Corentin asked if the suggestion was to just make the macro
          implemenation-defined.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that he thought that was what Fraser had suggested.</li>
      <li>Fraser confirmed.</li>
      <li>Jens asserted that the wording should preserve the condition that the
          macro, if defined, has a value with a particular syntactical
          form.</li>
      <li><b>Poll 1.1: Whether <tt>__STDC_ISO_10646__</tt> is predefined and if

      <li>Hubert noted some existing occurrences of "Unicode encoding" in the

      <li>Corentin reported that he did not see a reason to update that

      <li>Hubert stated that the relevant encodings should be restricted to

      <li>Corentin provided an introduction:
        <ul>
          <li>The wording substitutes "Unicode scalar value" for "character"
              in many places, but retains the latter in some contexts.</li>
          <li>This removes the "translation character set" indirection.</li>
          <li>The changes were mechanically applied.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>PBrett expressed support for the improved specificity.</li>
      <li>Corentin began reviewing the wording changes.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that Jens had previously requested an overview of the final
          state we are driving towards with these kinds of changes.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied that the motivation section addresses some of those
          concerns.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that he finds the proposed wording confusing since
          "character" ends up getting mixed in with Unicode terminology.</li>
      <li>Corentin explained that he has concerns about introducing a lot of
          churn that doesn't help to improve clarity.</li>
      <li>Fraser stated that additional specificity is probably needed to
          clarify which characters constitute new-line and whitespace.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that, with the exception of new-line, that characters are
          specified using Unicode code points.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that
          <a href="https://wg21.link/p2348">P2348 (Whitespaces Wording Revamp)</a>
          is relevant.</li>
      <li>Corentin explained that he intentionally did not modify the
          specification of whitespace in this paper.</li>
      <li>Corentin expressed a desire for agreement on the replacement of
          "elements of the translation character set".</li>
      <li>PBrett noticed an editorial issue in [lex.charset] for
          <em>n-char</em>; the updated wording retains "set" from the intended
          substitution of "Unicode code point" for "member of the translation
          character set".</li>
      <li>Jens observed that a change in [lex.phases] to substitute
          "Unicode scalar value" for
          ".. elements of the translation character set" retains a reference to
          [lex.charset] that no longer makes sense.</li>
      <li>Jens opined that the note in [lex.charset] that describes the
          difference between "code points" and "scalar values" should be
          retained.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that the location of that note is a little odd since it
          doesn't encapsulate the notion of "abstract character".</li>
      <li>Hubert observed that the updates to [lex.phases]p3 only updated one of
          the two uses of "space character".</li>
      <li>Corentin asked for opinions regarding a footnote in [lex.name] that
          discusses representation of characters outside the basic character set
          in external identifiers.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that the footnote could use some updates.</li>
      <li>Tom opined that the footnote should just be removed.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that
          <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/implimits#2.6">[implimits]p(2.6)</a>
          does specify a minimum limit for the number of significant characters
          in an external identifier.</li>
      <li>PBrett stated that the the uses of "character" in that annex need to
          be addressed.</li>
      <li>Corentin asked if CWG would be content with the removal of that
          footnote.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that he does not know but that he personally does not see
          value in retaining it; the note probably serviced its value 20 some
          years ago.</li>
      <li>Jens observed that "characters" would have to be interpreted as code
          points for the purposes of the external identifier limit.</li>
      <li>Tom noted the implication that, if UTF-8 was used for the encoding of
          external identifiers, a worst case limit must be assumed such that a
          limit of 1024 code points implies a limit of 4096 code units.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tom reported that SG16 will meet in one week, on 2023-02-01 in order to
      squeeze in one more review of P2749R0 before the WG21 meeting in
      Issaquah.</li>

<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Tom announced that this telecon is SG16's 100th!</li>
  <li>Corentin noted that LEWG is considering hosting an evening session in
      Issaquah to discuss Zach's
      <a href="https://wg21.link/p2728r0">P2728R0: Unicode in the Library, Part 1: UTF Transcoding</a>
      and
      <a href="https://wg21.link/p2729r0">P2729R0: Unicode in the Library, Part 2: Normalization</a>
      papers.</li>
  <li>Steve expressed support for early LEWG review so as to avoid a situation
      in which SG16 forwards a paper with interfaces that LEWG does not approve
      of; such cases have occurred with other study groups.</li>
  <li>PBrett noted that there are sometimes competing perspectives between what
      domain experts value and what LEWG values.</li>
  <li>PBrett acknowledged the possibility that LEWG will approve of Zach's
      design, that SG16 proceeds with making changes during its review, and that
      LEWG finds that it does not approve of the changed direction.</li>

          ]</em></li>
      <li>Tom provided a summary of the last telecon.</li>
      <li>Tom raised two concerns to be addressed.
        <ul>
          <li>Comments that Jens raised in a
              <a href="https://lists.isocpp.org/sg16/2023/01/3693.php">post to the SG16 mailing list</a>.</li>
          <li>Whether the paper should take a dependency on
              <a href="https://wg21.link/p2348">P2348 (Whitespaces Wording Revamp)</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Corentin explained that, with regard to Jens' concern about
          inconsistent use of the "Unicode code point" and "character" terms,
          that the changes made to mechanically replace "character" in 10-20
          pages of wording were quite extensive.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that, in cases where the wording refers to a specific
          character, such as U+0020 SPACE, that the term "character" is
          appropriate.</li>
      <li>Corentin acknowledged Jens' concerns, but noted that the updated
          wording does reduce ambiguity.</li>
      <li>Corentin claimed that the proposal includes a minimal change and that
          additional changes could be done editorially at a later time.</li>
      <li>Tom reported having spent time reviewing the changes and that he found
          the various uses of "Unicode scalar value", "Unicode code point", and
          "character" rather confusing.</li>
      <li>Tom expressed concern that the differences are subtle and that it
          might be unfair to place the project editor in the position of having
          to deal with those differences; at least not without clearly specified
          guidelines.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that the project editor shouldn't make such changes
          since they can have normative impact.</li>
      <li>Corentin reiterated that his goal with the paper is to remove the
          "translation character set" terminology in C++23 to avoid its
          appearance in new teaching materials.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested modifying the paper title to append "in lexing" since
          that better matches the scope of the proposed changes.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested reviewing the wording to ensure consistent terminology
          use.</li>
      <li>The group started reviewing the changes to [lex.phases].</li>
      <li>PBrett noted that people complain about the Unicode terms, but that
          their use is well justified in an international standard.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted the use of "character" in association with new-line and
          asked whether new-line could consist of multiple code points.</li>
      <li>Tom responded that, since the translation input is now specified in
          terms of Unicode code points, that we can define exactly what a
          new-line character is.</li>
      <li>Hubert agreed and stated that would provide a better basis for
          defining whitespace.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that <tt>\n</tt> can have platform impact in some contexts
          but that it doesn't in lexing.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied that more significant changes would be required to
          substitute U+000A LINE FEED for "new-line character" and that there
          would still be remaining uses of "character".</li>
      <li>PBrett stated it could be a conscious choice to leave those cases to a
          later paper like P2348.</li>
      <li>Hubert responded that the motivation for asking for additional work is
          to avoid increasing internal friction within the standard wording as
          the paper does now.</li>
      <li>Corentin expressed concern regarding incorporating work from P2348 due
          to concerns CWG had with that paper.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that, in lexing context, specifying new-line is not
          observable.</li>
      <li>Fraser asked if new-line characters are observable in raw string
          literals.</li>
      <li>Hubert replied negatively and explained that, in a raw string literal,
          new-line is mapped to <tt>\n</tt> in the execution character set.</li>
      <li>Steve stated issues with that were fixed.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that there are related CWG issues.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: See
          <a href="https://wg21.link/cwg1655">CWG issue 1655 (Line endings in raw string literals)</a>
          and
          <a href="https://wg21.link/cwg1709">CWG issue 1709 (Stringizing raw string literals containing newline)</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>Corentin pondered whether it is necessary to consider both papers at
          the same time.</li>
      <li>Hubert recommended sending a message to the CWG mailing list to ask
          about that.</li>
      <li>Corentin noted the substitution of a Unicode code point reference in
          place of "backslash character".</li>
      <li>Corentin mentioned that the changes are intended to allow "code point"
          to be used for non-Unicode character sets; hence "Unicode code point"
          is used in contexts specific to Unicode.</li>
      <li>Tom expressed uncertainty about the addition of "abstract" in
          [lex.phases]p1.</li>
      <li>Corentin responded that abstract characters are used to explain
          mapping between character sets.</li>
      <li>Tom agreed, but stated that wording is missing to tie the input to a
          sequence of abstract characters.</li>
      <li>Fraser suggested adding a statement to specify that the lexer
          processes a sequence of Unicode code points.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that the current wording limits the effort required to
          document how input is mapped to a sequence of characters.</li>
      <li>Corentin acknowledged that wording could be added to state that the
          implementation-defined mapping produces a sequence of Unicode scalar
          values.</li>
      <li>Corentin pointed out how "space character" and "whitespace character"
          is used differently in [lex.phases]p3.</li>
      <li>Mark observed that the changes to [lex.phases]p3 substituted
          "multi-Unicode code point" for "multi-character".</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested substituting
          "token comprising multiple Unicode code points" instead.</li>
      <li>Tom expressed support for substituting "U+0020 SPACE character" for
          "space character".</li>
      <li>Corentin observed that "character" can be omitted in the
          substitution.</li>
      <li>Hubert agreed.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested that, in [lex.charset], "code points" could be
          substituted for "characters" in
          "The basic character set is a subset ... consisting of 96 characters".</li>
      <li>Hubert replied that such a substitution would introduce a category
          error; the basic character set is intended to be a set of abstract
          characters and is used as such in some places.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested "The basic character set is a subset of the abstract
          characters included in the Unicode character set".</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested a simpler change;
          "the basic character set consists of the 96 characters specified in [lex.charset.basic]".</li>
      <li>Tom stated that the changes to the note in [lex.charset]p6 should
          state "Unicode code point" instead of just "code point" for
          consistency.</li>
      <li>PBrett opined that, with only 15 minutes remaining, that he did not
          think we'll be ready to forward the paper.</li>
      <li>Tom agreed and stated that he doesn't feel that we have sufficiently
          reviewed the paper to be confident in polling it.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that our goal is not to make a perfect standard, but rather
          to make improvements; we can poll forwarding it knowing that more
          work will be needed.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested polling to continue work and then poll a recommended
          resolution for the related NB comment in C++23.</li>
      <li>Steve asked what the motivation is for getting this change in
          C++23.</li>
      <li>Corentin responded that he is motivated to remove
          "translation character set" before it appears in training
          materials.</li>

<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p2773r0">P2773R0: Considerations for Unicode algorithms</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>PBrett suggested that Corentin provide a brief introductory overview
          by speaking to each of the points in the "TL;DR" section.</li>
      <li>Corentin presented an overview:
        <ul>
          <li>The paper is guided by experience obtained through
              prototyping.</li>
          <li>The paper is informed by expectations of performance
              requirements.</li>
          <li>Views are a good fit for Unicode algorithms.</li>
          <li>It is not clear what invariants would be desirable for a new text
              container.</li>
          <li>Unicode does not impose constraints on what code points may follow
              other ones; new code points can be inserted effectively
              anywhere.</li>
          <li>The paper assumes the availability of transcoding interfaces.</li>
          <li>Normalization should be an early focus.</li>
          <li>The existing interfaces for uppercase and lowercase operations in
              the C++ standard do not suffice to address the needs of all
              languages.</li>
          <li>The existing interfaces for case insensitive operations in the C++
              standard are likewise insufficient.</li>
          <li>Text operations need to be easy for programmers to use with UTF-8
              encoded text.</li>
          <li>Interfaces for text operations should not be replicated for every
              encoding of Unicode code points.</li>
          <li>It should be possible to, for example, perform casing and
              normalization operations without having to materialize a code
              point sequence in between the operations.</li>
          <li>The standard lacks localization facilities sufficient to support
              tailoring.</li>
          <li>Interfaces that support tailoring should be implemented using
              ICU4X.</li>
          <li>Interfaces for the non-tailored algorithms may be provided as
              <tt>constexpr</tt> since they are locale invariant.</li>
          <li>Providing views implemented with ICU would be challenging and
              would limit performance opportunities and iterator
              categories.</li>
          <li>Interfaces that support tailored algorithms with an interface
              similar to that used for non-tailored interfaces can be added
              later.</li>
          <li>Non-tailored interfaces are useful despite their being
              insufficient for user presentation purposes in general.</li>
          <li>There are no known use cases for performing normalization for
              non-Unicode encodings like EBCDIC or Shift-JIS.</li>
          <li>Code unit sequences should be validated by default on consumption;
              for safety reasons.</li>
          <li>Standardized interfaces should not be constrained by what ICU is
              capable of providing.</li>
          <li>Implementation via ICU should be supported when doing so doesn't
              limit potentially better solutions.</li>
          <li>Implementation via ICU prohibits <tt>constexpr</tt> and
              <tt>noexcept</tt>.</li>
          <li>Standardized interfaces should take advantage of ranges and
              views.</li>
          <li>Size hints are useful for reserving memory in order to avoid
              reallocations.</li>
          <li>It is important and reasonable to optimize table lookups for most
              character properties.</li>
          <li>In place mutation of text does not perform well.</li>
          <li>UTF decoding and encoding is inexpensive even when not optimized;
              it might not be necessary to design every interface to support
              maximum optimization possibilities.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Zach stated that normalization is a relatively expensive operation
          and is therefore best suited to eager transformations.</li>
      <li>Victor commented in the chat that lazy operations often limit
          optimizations like SIMD.</li>
      <li>Jens also commented in the chat that range filters are probably at
          odds with SIMD, noted that table lookups aren't SIMD-friendly, and
          pondered how much the Unicode algorithms benefit from SIMD.</li>
      <li>Zach noted that maintaining multiple levels of enclosed iterators
          can be painful.</li>
      <li>Zach reflected on prior discussions regarding requirements to be able
          to implement Unicode functionality using ICU and asked how important
          such implementability is.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note:
          <a href="https://wg21.link/p1238">P1238R1 (SG16: Unicode Direction)</a>
          lists as a constraint that implementors cannot afford to rewrite ICU.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>Tom responded that his prior statements were partially motivated by
          politics; a desire to assure implementors that SG16's efforts would
          not culminate in a requirement for them to implement all Unicode
          functionality on their own.</li>
      <li>PBrett indicated that he is not worried regarding implementability
          via ICU.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that the pipeline approach presented in the paper allows
          combining transformations in ways that may be order dependent.</li>
      <li>Tom asked Robin to confirm that case folding and normalization
          operations are order dependent.</li>
      <li>Robin noted that case folding does not depend on tailoring and
          confirmed that there are order dependencies;
          <tt>toCasefold(toNFKC(S))</tt> does not produce the same result as
          <tt>toNFKC_Casefold(S)</tt>.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: In later correspondence, Robin noted that Turkic
          case folding (I -&gt; ı, İ -&gt; i) is usually not performed for
          non-Turkic languages as noted in
          <a href="https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/CaseFolding.txt">CaseFolding.txt</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>Robin stated that, for canonical normalization, it is common to
          normalize at program boundaries, but that compatibility normalization
          might need to be done locally.</li>
      <li>Tom noted the implication; programmers can't expect to combine
          transformations arbitrarily and get the "right" result.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that this means special algorithms are needed for some
          transformations.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that the range pipeline approach is idiomatic and seems
          amenable to these transformations.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that ranges was tranformational in its ability to avoid
          the need for intermediate storage.</li>
      <li>Jens cautioned that this ability comes with the cost that the
          transformations be interruptible.</li>
      <li>Jens expressed appreciation for the syntax that views enable but that
          he would like to understand the performance trade off with respect to
          eager transformations.</li>
      <li>Jens asserted it would be useful to have some performance data in a
          paper.</li>
      <li>Jens acknowledged that normalization as a view adapter would require
          some local memory, but noted that might be cache advantageous.</li>
      <li>Steve expressed concern over including normalization as a pipeline
          stage; if normalization iterators have to bounce between various
          buffers, performance may suffer.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that views can be materialized when it is advantageous to
          do so.</li>
      <li>PBrett reported that he has applications for normalization views.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that it is probably advantageous to materialize a
          view if it will be iterated more than once.</li>
      <li>Corentin reported having implemented a normalization view and that he
          did not find the implementation to be too difficult.</li>
      <li>Corentin noted that normalization can benefit from limits like those
          specified in the stream-safe text format.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: The stream-safe text format is described in
          <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr15">UAX #15 (Unicode Normalization Forms)</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>Corentin commented that normalization can be expensive, but only when
          transformations are actually necessary; characters corresponding to
          some of the <tt>General_Category</tt> classes can be recognized and
          copied without further lookup.</li>
      <li>Victor stated that, with regard to implementability with ICU and the
          benefits of range based interfaces, good performance is more
          important.</li>
      <li>Victor advised creating a reference implementation so that performance
          can be evaluated relative to ICU.</li>
      <li>Victor noted that we do not want another experience like
          <tt>std::regex</tt> where the implementations available exhibit poor
          performance.</li>
      <li>Zach reported having compared performance between his
          <a href="https://tzlaine.github.io/text/doc/html/index.html">Boost.Text</a>
          implementation and ICU and found his implementation initially lagged
          ICU performance by 50 times.</li>
      <li>Zach explained that he was able to improve performance after studying
          the implementation in ICU, but that his implementation was still 10
          times as expensive as ICU.</li>
      <li>Zach asserted that we should not expect implementors to match ICU
          performance.</li>
      <li>Zach declared that we don't want to specify a facility that will pose
          a decade long implementation challenge as happened with
          <tt>std::from_chars()</tt> and <tt>std::to_chars()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Zach noted that the lazy range approach can be implemented using
          ICU.</li>
      <li>Zach suggested that we can specify both eager and view based
          implementations.</li>
      <li>PBrett provided a use case for lazy normalization; Unicode regular
          expression matching can perform better with NFKD normalized text and
          it can be advantageous to only normalize until a match is found.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied to Victor's request for a reference implementation
          that he would make his prototype work available, but that better
          implementations are possible.</li>
      <li>Corentin expressed skepticism that there isn't room to improve on
          ICU performance.</li>
      <li>Tom asked Robin if the CLDR follows
          <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47">BCP-47</a>.</li>
      <li>Robin replied that they are maintained in sync and that the CLDR uses
          some extensions defined in BCP-47.</li>
      <li>Robin stated that, with regard to standardizing localization support,
          localization is fundamentally not stable since it tracks evolving
          human behavior.</li>
      <li>Robin noted that, since the C++ standard is updated every 3 years, it
          will always trail localization changes.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: Robin noted in later offline discussion that
          CLDR releases occur at least every six months. ]</em></li>
      <li>Tom asked if some of the locale properties specified in BCP-47 are
          stable.</li>
      <li>Robin replied that BCP-47 specifies a syntax and that it has some
          stability assurances.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: Robin provided additional detail in offline
          correspondence following the telecon; The relation between Unicode
          language and locale identifiers and BCP-47 is documented in the

          and stability is discussed in the

      <li>Corentin recalled discussion of Zach's papers in Issaquah and noted
          that the level of stability guarantees is not sufficient for ABI
          purposes.</li>
      <li>Robin reported that the line breaking algorithm changes frequently
          but that other algorithmes, like grapheme breaking, change less
          frequently.</li>
      <li>Robin advised focusing on use cases when considering the Unicode
          algorithms as different use cases may have different concerns.</li>
      <li>Robin noted that case folding has stability concerns and that it is
          stable for NFKC normalized text.</li>

          a case-insensitive search.</li>

      <li>PBrett introduced the agenda.</li>
      <li>Robin provided an overview of tailoring:
        <ul>
          <li><em>[ Editor's note: Robin shared his notes following the meeting;
              they can be found

          <li>Points 3 and 5 of the "TL;DR" portion of the paper are related to
              tailoring.</li>
          <li>Normalization is noted as a priority in the paper and that is a
              good thing as there are examples of languages and products that do
              not handle normalization well.</li>
          <li>The Unicode standard provides examples of tailoring, but those
              examples are not prescriptive.</li>
          <li>Tailoring does not mean "language dependent"; it permits many
              kinds of transformations.</li>
          <li>Case folding has exactly one case of language specific behavior;

              <li>ICU supports this behavior via a boolean flag on case folding
                  interfaces.</li>

              tailoring.</li>
          <li>UAX #29 provides examples of language-dependent grapheme cluster
              tailoring, but at present, that isn't done in practice.
            <ul>
              <li>The CLDR technical committee is experimenting with a
                  language-independent tailoring of grapheme clusters with a
                  different behavior for Indic scripts.
                  That work has not been forwarded to the UTC yet, but is
                  intended to eventually be used as the new default default
                  behavior.</li>
              <li>Changes to
                  <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr29">UAX #29 (Unicode Text Segmentation)</a>
                  are likely to be proposed.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>ICU supports tailoring for line breaking beyond what is stated in
              the Unicode Standard:
            <ul>
              <li>Support for dictionary based layout for Thai.</li>
              <li>Machine learning based layout for Burmese, Chinese, Japanese,
                  and Thai.</li>
              <li>Different line breaking rules for numbers.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Line breaking behavior can be script based as opposed to language
              based.</li>
          <li>Case mapping includes language specific tailoring.</li>
          <li>Collation is used for sorting, but is also used for case
              insensitive search:
            <ul>
              <li>The French word "ŒUF" is primary-equal to "oeuf" for collation,
                  but case-folding would not produce a match.</li>
              <li>The German word "fuer" matches "für" in German, but not in
                  French.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Fraser shared in chat:
          "my favourite tailoring (for collation) is that in traditional name
          collation in Scotland, surnames starting "Mc" (e.g. McAdam) sort as
          if they begin "Mac" (so McAdam and MacAdam sort equivalently)."</li>
      <li>PBrett noted that, in some Scandinavian dictionaries, words beginning
          with Å (U+00C5 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE) get ordered
          differently when they correspond to a place name, but not
          otherwise.</li>
      <li>PBrett added that, in Japanese, kanji have different meaning if they
          form part of a person's name as opposed to part of another word.</li>
      <li>Corentin asked for examples of production systems that handle these
          cases correctly.</li>
      <li>Robin replied that collation tailoring doesn't generally perform
          natural language processing, but noted that locale specifiers may
          include extensions for phone book order, dictionary order, or other
          ordering forms.</li>
      <li>PBrett stated that it is common for programmers to want to sort in
          many different ways and shared examples of ordering by surname vs
          address.</li>
      <li>Robin replied that the CLDR provides data for some of those
          applications and provided an example of ordering contacts for display
          on a phone.</li>
      <li>Robin noted that the non-tailored collation algorithm will produce
          incorrect results for many languages but will still be more accurate
          than sorting by, for example, code point values.</li>
      <li>Corentin asserted that collation support is necessary, but that it
          should not be considered high priority for now.</li>
      <li>Corentin noted that support for collation is responsible for a
          significant proportion of the data included with ICU.</li>
      <li>Robin stated that Swift supports non-tailored EGCs and both default
          and language dependent collation and case mapping.</li>
      <li>Robin noted that Swift encountered some challenges with their EGC
          segmentation and regional indicators but have not, in general, had
          issues with instability and
          <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr29">UAX #29 (Unicode Text Segmentation)</a>.</li>
      <li>Robin reported that, with highly unstable data, programmers will
          generally want to opt-in to updates independently of compiler
          upgrades.</li>
      <li>Tom observed that might be an argument for providing Unicode
          versioned interfaces in some cases.</li>
      <li>Robin agreed, but advised doing so only for highly unstable data.</li>
      <li>Corentin asked about governance of the CLDR:
        <ul>
          <li>Is there a specification?</li>
          <li>Is there a stability policy?</li>
          <li>Could the CLDR be referenced from the C++ standard?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Robin replied that he does not think the CLDR has a stability
          policy.</li>
      <li>Robin stated that the CLDR is released every six months, that it
          moves fast, and that it is maintained by its own committee within
          the Unicode Consortium.</li>
      <li>Robin noted that the syntax used for the CLDR data is standardized via
          <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr35">UTS #35 (Unicode Locale Data Markup Language (LDML))</a>.</li>
      <li>Tom asked if UTS #35 could be used as a specification to implement an
          interface to the CLDR as a data source.</li>
      <li>Robin replied that it could be in principle but that compatibility
          problems might arise if the CLDR version is not aligned with the
          implemented version of UTS #35.</li>
      <li>Corentin asked Robin if he agreed that it would be useful to add
          support for non-tailored case transformations in the near term.</li>
      <li>Robin replied that doing so would be a considerable improvement over
          the status quo.</li>
      <li>Robin noted that programmers that use the locale independent
          interfaces where they should not will attract appropriate attention
          from the internationalization proponents within their
          organization.</li>
      <li>PBrett observed that there is a segment of programmers that might not
          care about collation being correct for various locales.</li>
      <li>Corentin agreed and noted that ICU must be used today for locale
          specific support and then observed that having locale independent
          interfaces might prompt programmers to do the right thing.</li>
      <li>Robin asserted that providing non-tailored interfaces would be
          benefitial and that the standard should note their appropriate
          use.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked for comments regarding how tailored interfaces should
          be provided.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied that tailoring has different requirements and
          requires different types.</li>
      <li>Corentin suggested that such types can perhaps be hidden from
          programmers; for example, views that adjust the types used based on
          provision of a locale object.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked if tailoring should be expressed via locale facets or if
          it is sufficiently disjoint from locale that it should have its own
          facility.</li>
      <li>Corentin opined that we should not further build on
          <tt>std::locale</tt>, but that an interface that accepts some kind of
          locale object to opt-in to tailoring without other customization is
          possible.</li>
      <li>Corentin noted that ICU4X allows customization via "providers" in
          addition to locale-based tailoring.</li>
      <li>Corentin expressed uncertainty whether customization beyond
          locale-based tailoring should be provided.</li>
      <li>Robin replied that tailoring is unbounded and thus too vast a concept
          to be used in an unqualified manner.</li>
      <li>Robin stated that support for
          <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr35">UTS #35 (Unicode Locale Data Markup Language (LDML))</a>
          would likely be required to do more, but that probably isn't feasible
          for the near future.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that <tt>std::locale</tt> facets support customization
          but that the design can't possibly account for all tailoring
          possibilities.</li>
      <li>Corentin expressed a preference for an implementation-defined
          locale-based design.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that tailoring appears to mean a lot of things, that it
          isn't clear why or how we would provide an interface, and that we are
          unlikely to specify use of an AI for line breaking.</li>
      <li>Jens opined that tailoring appears to go beyond the existing
          facilities that do things like replacing "." with "," when formatting
          numbers.</li>
      <li>Jens asserted that programmers can insert their own transformations
          and that the standard does not have to provide support other than via
          interoperability.</li>
      <li>Jens opined that there is not a need to invest time in that direction
          now.</li>
      <li>Jens agreed that there are likely cases that can be plausibly and
          meaningfully provided based on locale.</li>
      <li>Jens expressed skepticism that we'll pursue a replacement for
          <tt>std::locale</tt> in the near term.</li>
      <li>Jens expressed support for specifying some tailored algorithms when
          the tailoring can be specified with few parameters.</li>
      <li>Hubert shared a perspective that <tt>std::locale</tt> facets are
          extensions of what C provides.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that it might have been a mistake to make
          <tt>std::locale</tt> extensible, but such extensions remain an option
          subject to the limitation that these objects are tied to the C
          locale ID.</li>
      <li>Tom asked if there is reason to believe that it is not sufficient for
          programmers to be able to insert their own tailored transformations
          in pipelines that they construct.</li>
      <li>PBrett pondered whether the standard library should include non-DUCET
          data.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: The Default Unicode Collation Element Table
          (DUCET) is decribed in
          <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr10">UTS #10 (Unicode Collation Algorithm)</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>Jens asked why we would provide data if we don't provide algorithms
          that use it.</li>
      <li>PBrett replied that the availability of the data could enable
          programmers to use it to provide their own tailoring.</li>
      <li>Corentin responded that, given an expectation that programmers provide
          their own algorithms, there is nothing to provide.</li>
      <li>Corentin noted that the more we provide, the greater the risk that
          we'll have to break it later.</li>
      <li>Corentin asserted that the CLDR data cannot be consumed in a similar
          manner to timezone data.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested that such consumption should be possible with an
          implementation of the LDML.</li>
      <li>Corentin responded that providing such an implementation is equivalent
          to implementing ICU.</li>
      <li>Corentin shared an understanding that ICU's complexity is primarily
          due to integration with the CLDR.</li>
      <li>Corentin expressed our task as determining how implementors can
          provide CLDR-based tailoring using ICU or ICU4X.</li>
      <li>Corentin noted the implication with regard to portability and
          suggested ICU4X might provide a better building block.</li>
      <li>Robin noted his own association with ICU4X and expressed its goal to
          improve portability based on a more flexible and modular design.</li>
      <li>Robin stated that ICU4X does not offer strong stability
          guarantees.</li>
      <li>Robin agreed with the perspective that implementing support for LDML
          is tantamount to implementing half of ICU.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that the existing C++ collation support is not
          customizable and that it simply exposes what is provided by the
          C library.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested it might be feasible to provide the DUCET data in a
          pre-compiled form.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: doing so would potentially side step the LDML
          implementation concerns. ]</em></li>
      <li>Jens noted that, for collation, we all have an intuitive understanding
          that languages work differently, but that such understanding is less
          clear for other algorithms.</li>

<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p2728r0">P2728R0 (Unicode in the Library, Part 1: UTF Transcoding</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>Zach provided an introduction:
        <ul>
          <li>The proposal provides interfaces to facilitate conversion between
              the UTF encodings.</li>
          <li>The intent is to provide support for ranges and iterators equally
              well.</li>
          <li>The proposed interfaces allow for use of SIMD operations with
              contiguous iterators.</li>
          <li>Transcoding algorithms are also proposed.</li>
          <li>Special accommodations are privided for easy use of
              null-terminated strings.</li>
          <li>The ubquity of string literals and pointers to <tt>char</tt>
              motivates specialized interfaces.</li>
          <li>The proposed interfaces constrain code unit types based on size,
              not particular character type.</li>
          <li>Code unit types could also be constrained to particular character
              types but algorithms are generally not so constrained; this design
              is more general.</li>
          <li>Most programmers are expected to use higher level interfaces, but
              these lower level interfaces enable specialized behavior; e.g.,
              for text chunking.</li>
          <li>A <tt>null_sentinel_t</tt> type and a corresponding
              <tt>null_sentinel</tt> variable enable generalized support for
              null terminated strings.</li>
          <li>Additional utilities like <tt>is_encoded</tt> and
              <tt>find_invalid_encoding</tt> provide nice-to-have
              functionality.</li>
          <li>The <tt>transcode_to_utf8</tt> and similar functions could be
              expanded to perform UTF validation without transcoding.</li>
          <li>Transcoding iterators are provided for converting between UTF
              encodings.</li>
          <li>Error handling is configurable, but only one error handling policy
              is currently specified; <tt>use_replacement_character</tt>.</li>
          <li>Insert, front-insert, back-insert, and output transcoding
              iterators are specified with associated factory functions.</li>
          <li>It is expected that the transcoding views would be most frequently
              used.</li>
          <li>The <tt>as_utf</tt> family of functions return a type that, given
              a sequence of code units in one UTF encoding, provides a view of
              code units for another UTF encoding.</li>
          <li>Formatter specializations are provided for the views.</li>
          <li>The transcoding iterators wrap a range, not just a single
              iterator, because advancing the iterator might advance the
              underlying iterator multiple times thus requiring a sentinel to
              recognize the end of the underlying range.</li>
          <li>Wrapping a transcoding iterator in another transcoding iterator
              yields a transcoding iterator from the base UTF encoding to the
              final one; this avoids accumulating multiple levels of wrapped
              iterators without requiring type erasure.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Fraser reported in chat that there is a stray single quotation mark in
          the <tt>requires</tt> expression in one of the <tt>operator==</tt>
          declarations for <tt>utf_8_to_16_iterator</tt> in section 4.6.1,
          "First, the basic ones".</li>
      <li>Jens stated that the proposed factory functions are probably not
          needed if support for class template argument deduction (CTAD) can be
          provided.</li>
      <li>Zach replied that he added them to follow existing precedent in the
          standard but agreed they could be omitted.</li>
      <li>Tom expressed surprise regarding the proposed behavior of
          <tt>as_utf8()</tt>; he expected a function with that name to provide a
          view that decodes UTF-8 from underlying data in order to produce code
          points.</li>
      <li>Zach replied that the proposed <tt>as_utf8()</tt> design provides a
          view of UTF-8 code units (not code points) by transcoding from
          whatever encoding the underlying data is encoded in.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that the proposed transcoding views (e.g.,
          <tt>utf8_view</tt>) don't appear to function like other view
          adapters.</li>
      <li>Hubert agreed and noted that, unlike other view or iterator adapters,
          it appears that these views place additional semantic requirements on
          the iterator template parameters.</li>
      <li>Zach explained that, if <tt>as_utf8()</tt> is passed a pair of
          pointers to <tt>char</tt> that the iterator/sentinel pair is returned
          as is.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that, for <tt>utf8_view</tt>, that makes
          <tt>utf8_iter</tt> an odd choice of name.</li>
      <li>Jens explained that requiring transcoding work to be performed by the
          provided <tt>utf8_iter</tt> is very surprising.</li>
      <li>Zach replied that the design is similar to
          <tt>std::ranges::filter_view</tt>; that view uses a filter
          iterator.</li>
      <li>Jens explained that there is a difference; <tt>filter_view</tt>
          defines a member type that functions as an iterator adapter and
          performs the work; in the proposed design, the user provided iterator
          does the work.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that, if the provided iterator does all the work, then
          the view doesn't adapt anything.</li>
      <li>Corentin asserted that <tt>utf8_view</tt> does effectively the same
          thing that <tt>std::ranges::subrange</tt> does.</li>
      <li>Zach replied that there is a difference in that the transcoding views
          add a constraint that the provided iterator satisfy
          <tt>utf_iter</tt>.</li>
      <li>Fraser asked if it is intended that <tt>as_utf8()</tt> should be
          usable with, for example, a code page iterator that transcodes to
          UTF-8.</li>
      <li>Zach replied affirmatively.</li>
      <li>Corentin asserted that this design is a departure from prior ranges
          work.</li>
      <li>Hubert observed that the transcoding algorithms, unlike the
          transcoding iterators, do not allow for an error handler to be
          provided and asked Zach to confirm that they are intended to be less
          customizable and that programmers can use iterators in a loop to
          satisfy custom requirements.</li>
      <li>Zach confirmed and explained that the transcoding algorithms are
          intended to provide the functionality that is most often wanted,
          replacement character substitution, at high speed.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that support for segmented data that is not necessarily
          aligned on a code unit sequence boundary requires a way to store a
          partial code unit sequence so that it can be completed by the
          following segment rather than substituting a replacement character for
          the partial sequence.</li>
      <li>Zach replied that a programmer could handle that requirement by
          checking that the segment ends with a complete code unit sequence by
          assigning an iterator to the end of the segment and decoding
          backwards.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested another approach would be to signal the end of the
          sequence early and then check if the base iterator has reached its
          end.</li>
      <li>Zach repled that adding additional semantics would complicate the
          usage experience.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that, with regard to performance considerations, the work
          that JeanHeyd has been doing in WG14 offers more flexibility for error
          handling.</li>
      <li>Hubert asked if the transcoding iterator hierarchy unpacking is
          exposed such that a programmer could take advantage of it.</li>
      <li>Zach replied that he had not considered exposing it, but that doing so
          is a possibility that could be looked into.</li>
      <li>Zach agreed that it would be useful to have generalized support for
          such unpacking.</li>
      <li>Tom directed discussion towards the notion of using <tt>char32_t</tt>
          as a general Unicode code point type.</li>
      <li>Zach mentioned that his proposal uses <tt>uint32_t</tt>.</li>
      <li>Robin noted that ICU's <tt>UCHAR</tt> type is an alias of
          <tt>int32_t</tt>.</li>
      <li>Zach explained that the <tt>value_type</tt> of the UTF-32 iterators
          need only be a sufficiently sized integral type; not always a specific
          type like <tt>char32_t</tt>.</li>
      <li>Zach argued that the design should allow adaptation to the types the
          programmer is using.</li>
      <li>Jens asserted that the <tt>value_type</tt> of the UTF-32 converting
          iterators should be <tt>char32_t</tt> and that programmers can provide
          range wrappers for other types.</li>
      <li>Steve expressed support for always using <tt>char32_t</tt> because
          doing so enables overloading without ambiguity.</li>
      <li>Steve conveyed agreement with use of an adapter for other types.</li>
      <li>Fraser also expressed support for use of the <tt>charN_t</tt> types
          with the rationale that programmers should not be punished for using
          the right types.</li>
      <li>Fraser acknowledged that the design should not encourage casts.</li>
      <li>PBindels stated in chat, "I value new code getting warnings / errors
          on bad conversions, over legacy code getting support without
          casts."</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd reported that his implementation supports a configuration
          option that allows for use of a Unicode code point type other than
          <tt>char32_t</tt> and that every time he tries to exercise it that
          things break.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd provided a link in chat to the documentation for the
          configuration option;
          <a href="https://ztdtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#config-ztd-text-unicode-code-point-distinct-type">https://ztdtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#config-ztd-text-unicode-code-point-distinct-type</a>.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd added that, for older code bases, casts end up getting used
          regardless.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd suggested that, if a choice has to be made, <tt>char32_t</tt>
          be preferred but with a possible opt-in option for use of another type
          by a minority of users.</li>
      <li>Zach stated that a template parameter could be added to types like
          <tt>utf_8_to_32_iterator</tt> to allow for a custom
          <tt>value_type</tt>.</li>
      <li>Zach asserted that the <tt>charN_t</tt> types are fine in some cases,
          but that the community currently uses <tt>char</tt> and
          <tt>wchar_t</tt> for UTF-8 and UTF-16 respectively and that it would
          be a shame to force the <tt>charN_t</tt> types on such users.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that the choice of types accepted for input vs output
          are orthogonal.</li>
      <li>Corentin asserted that it makes sense to specify a single type for the
          Unicode code point type for many uses, such as for working with EGCs
          and argued that <tt>char32_t</tt> is the right type.</li>
      <li>Corentin noted that support for historical uses could hurt
          composability and stated that imposing questions of what type to use
          on programmers should be avoided.</li>
      <li>Corentin admitted that few people use <tt>char8_t</tt> and
          <tt>char16_t</tt> and stated that we can accept use of <tt>char</tt>
          and <tt>wchar_t</tt> with the caveat that programmers don't understand
          what the associated encodings are.</li>
      <li>Corentin expressed appreciation for the <tt>charN_t</tt> types having
          well-defined associated encodings.</li>
      <li>Jens argued that the library is too large as currently proposed and
          that it needs to be pruned and made more orthogonal.</li>
      <li>Jens insisted that we should be courageous; we are the standardization
          committee and we define what the future should look like.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that the standard containers were forward looking and the
          legacy container-like libraries are all gone now.</li>
      <li>Jens encouraged designing for composability by specifying elementary
          builing blocks that can be combined.</li>
      <li>Jens asserted that it is ok if programmers are required to write a few
          wrappers for use with their existing projects.</li>
      <li>Zach asked what Jens would suggest cutting.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested removing the front, back, and insert iterators, perhaps
          in favor of a generic adapter that facilitates use with the existing
          front, back, and insert iterators.</li>
      <li>Jens added that the full matrix of UTF converters should be avoided in
          favor of conversion from one UTF encoding to a code point sequence and
          then to another UTF encoding.</li>
      <li>Jens expressed a desire for diagnostics on bad conversion as Peter
          Bindels mentioned in chat.</li>
      <li>Zach asked if that would imply issuing diagnostics for input provided
          in other integer types.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that a transform view can be used to explicitly support
          those cases.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that he wants a view that works more like other views; not
          like <tt>as_utf8</tt> in this proposal.</li>
      <li>Jens requested that range object adapters be proposed instead of
          functions.</li>
      <li>Jens explained that functions are problematic because of argument
          dependent lookup (ADL) and that range object adapters avoid that
          problem.</li>
      <li>Zach replied that his implementation uses customization point objects
          (CPOs), that the paper doesn't reflect that, but that it should.</li>
      <li>Victor stated that the project he works on contains a massive amount
          of code that assumes data held in <tt>char</tt>-based storage is
          UTF-8; that and similar projects require first class support for use
          of UTF-8 with <tt>char</tt>.</li>
      <li>Victor reported that his project has banned use of <tt>char8_t</tt>
          due to conflicts introduced when programmers tried to use it.</li>
      <li>Victor stated that, based on his basic understanding of Zach's
          proposal, the proposed design accommodates such usage.</li>
      <li>Tom asked Victor if such first class support could be conditionally
          provided based on the literal encoding being UTF-8.</li>
      <li>Victor replied that doing so could make sense.</li>
      <li>Victor indicated that, without good support for use of UTF-8 with
          <tt>char</tt>, his project would probably recommend against use of
          the facility.</li>
      <li>Corentin reported having considered implicit first class support for
          UTF-8 and <tt>char</tt> when the literal encoding is UTF-8, noted that
          such code is not portable, but expressed hope that such code would
          fail compilation rather than produce mojibake.</li>
      <li>Corentin suggested decreasing the size of the library by first
          focusing on a view and then adding eager converters and inserters
          later.</li>
      <li>Corentin expressed appreciation for the focus on UTF encodings vs
          support for all encodings.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that his and JeanHeyd's prior work on a <tt>text_view</tt>
          type that uses codecs satisfied a number of the composability
          concerns that Jens raised.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd agreed that codecs provide more flexibility.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd noted that bulk speed is attainable with his, Tom's and
          Zach's designs.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd stated that codecs impose performance overhead relative to
          iterators due to state management but that good QoI can mitigate those
          costs.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd observed that <tt>short</tt>, <tt>int</tt>, <tt>wchar_t</tt>,
          and other types have historically been used for text because the
          <tt>charN_t</tt> types weren't available.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd asserted that whether and how programmers migrate to
          <tt>charN_t</tt> types depends on how difficult we make such a
          transition.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd suggested that <tt>charN_t</tt> types be used by default due
          to their overloading abilities and strong encoding associations.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd declared that, for <tt>char</tt> and <tt>wchar_t</tt>, one
          has to assume an encoding and, most of the time, that works out ok,
          but when it doesn't, it is a problem.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd commented that the codec approach works well for handling
          <tt>char</tt> and <tt>wchar_t</tt>, but less well with iterators.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd insisted that the missing library support for
          <tt>charN_t</tt> is an impediment.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd reported that the work he is doing is more encompassing.</li>
      <li>Fraser asked whether anyone has written a paper regarding the pain
          points with using the <tt>charN_t</tt> types.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied that standard library support is missing.</li>
      <li>Jens provided specific examples of missing support; <tt>printf()</tt>,
          <tt>std::format()</tt>, and <tt>std::iostreams</tt>.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd agreed that the most significant problem is the inability to
          conveniently print data held in those types.</li>
      <li>Corentin agreed that the lack of support for <tt>charN_t</tt> types in
          <tt>std::format()</tt> is a big issue.</li>
      <li>Steve replied that we would have to figure out what it means to print
          <tt>char32_t</tt>.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested we might be able to specify it for
          <tt>std::print()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Steve tentatively agreed but noted a need to consider locale
          impact.</li>
      <li>Victor agreed that locale issues need to be addressed.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that these are the reasons that Python 3 moved to the
          <tt>C.UTF-8</tt> locale by default.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: The Python 3 migration to the <tt>C.UTF-8</tt>
          locale was proposed in
          <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0538">PEP 538 (Coercing the legacy C locale to a UTF-8 based locale)</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>JeanHeyd noted that there is still a lot of code in the wild that
          assumes ASCII.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tom announced that the next meeting will be on April 12th and that we'll
      continue discussion of this paper.</li>
  <li>Tom suggested we should review the prior work on <tt>text_view</tt> given
      how long it has been since we've discussed it.</li>
</ul>
