<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><em>[ Editor's note: We did not have quorum due to low attendance;
      as a result, no polls were taken. ]</em></li>
  <li><em>[ Editor's note: Changes made in a draft of
      <a href="https://wg21.link/p1885r9">P1885R9</a>
      were material to review of the papers on the agenda, so we first
      reviewed it. ]</em></li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p1885r9">P1885R9: Naming Text Encodings to Demystify Them</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Jens stated that there is a procedural question related to the
          changes made in this revision; the new draft changes the design
          after electronic polling.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that the changes were at least partially inspired by
          comments received on the proposal by electronic polling participants
          and were intended to increase consensus.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted that the polled revision did not have the wording to
          mandate <tt>CHAR_BIT == 8</tt> due to a procedural error and asked
          whether that warranted follow up with LEWG.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked what it means in practice for the wording to mandate
          <tt>CHAR_BIT == 8</tt>.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that it requires a call to a function specified with
          that wording to be ill-formed if the requirement is violated.</li>
      <li>Jens explained that implementors can conform with this requirement
          by defining such functions as deleted, implementing them as a
          function template with an appropriate <tt>static_assert</tt>, or
          similar.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked for more details regarding implementation as a function
          template and whether the functions could simply not be declared
          at all.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that a function template is ok because taking the address
          of a standard library function is not allowed; the standard just
          requires a call expression to be well-formed.</li>
      <li>Hubert explained that the name must be declared due to interaction
          with name lookup.</li>
      <li>Jens stated an implementation preference to define the function as
          deleted.</li>
      <li>PBrett: noticed that the revision history simply stated
          "Wording fixes" with no details.</li>
      <li>Tom volunteered to review the R8 and R9 revisions and to summarize
          the differences in the meeting summary.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: Tom did so; the wording differences identified include:
        <ul>
          <li>An additional <tt>using enum id</tt> declaration was added to
              the definition of <tt>text_encoding</tt>.</li>
          <li>The <tt>wide_literal()</tt>, <tt>wide_environment()</tt>, and
              <tt>wide_environment_is()</tt> declarations were removed and
              wording that referred to them adjusted accordingly.</li>
          <li>"character encoding" was changed to "character encoding scheme"
              in the paragraph following the note regarding how the names of
              <tt>text_encoding::id</tt> enumerators were derived from the
              IANA registry.</li>
          <li>A paragraph describing invariants maintained by
              <tt>text_encoding</tt> was added.</li>
          <li>Wording that introduced and used
              <tt>SUBSTITUTE_UTF_ENCODING()</tt> for mapping the bigendian and
              littleendian UTF-16 and UTF-32 schemes to their respective
              encoding forms was removed; related wording was adjusted
              accordingly.</li>
          <li>Wording to mandate <tt>CHAR_BIT == 8</tt> was added
              throughout.</li>
        </ul>
      ]</em>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p2491r0">P2491R0: Text encodings follow-up</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Jens summarized the paper.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that the changes in P1885R9 improve consistency with the
          IANA intent and P1885 usage.</li>
      <li>Jens added that there is opportunity for specification improvements,
          but that they can be addressed during LWG review.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that the wording plan described in the paper indicated
          intent to remove the requirement that <tt>CHAR_BIT == 8</tt>.</li>
      <li>Jens confirmed, but expressed a lack of concern; that restriction can
          be removed if motivation to do so arises.</li>
      <li>PBrett expressed a preference for explicit specification for how IANA
          octets are mapped to C++ code units.</li>
      <li>Jens agreed, stated that can be done during LWG review, and expressed
          a preference for a normative sentence that maps an IANA octet to a
          <tt>char</tt> code unit.</li>
      <li>Jens expressed a belief that relying on IANA for anything other than
          octets would be a mistake.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked if Jens had an alternative to suggest.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that he did not, but that such concerns usually arose
          during discussion of UTF-16 and UTF-32.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that mapping to IANA in those cases is feasible, but
          noted that there are multiple possible mappings that may be platform
          dependent; particularly when the size of <tt>char</tt> is not 8
          bits.</li>
      <li>PBrett agreed, but noted that a particular mapping could be required
          for a conforming implementation.</li>
      <li>Tom added that a non-conforming implementation would map to "other"
          in that case.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p2498r0">P2498R0: Forward compatibility of text_encoding with additional encoding registries</a>
    <ul>
      <li>PBrett introduced the proposal:
        <ul>
          <li>Character encoding repositories other than IANA exist.</li>
          <li>The mapping to IANA should be explicit such that a mapping to
              another registry could be gracefully introduced in the future if
              motivation arises.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>PBrett summarized the proposed changes:
        <ul>
          <li>Rename "id" to "iana_id"</li>
          <li>Rename "mib" to "iana_mib"</li>
          <li>Add recommended practice to avoid implementations creating an
              over dependence on IANA.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>PBrett asked for opinions on the proposed renames.</li>
      <li>Victor asked if other viable candidate registries exist in practice
          and stated that, if not, the proposed renames seem premature.</li>
      <li>PBrett replied that there are NB concerns about IANA being an
          unregulated, unaccountable, and unreliable organization.</li>
      <li>PBrett added that examples of other registries can be found in the
          <a href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org">WhatWG Encoding Standard</a>,
          IBM's <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/G01BQVRV">Character Data Representation Architecture (CDRA)</a>,
          and <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/22747.html">ISO/IEC 2022:1994</a>.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted that the paper does not propose the addition of another
          registry; just the possibility to add more in the future in a
          seamless manner.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested adding examples of other registries to the paper.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded with concern that doing so might create disruption
          for the advancement of P1885 and result in considerable time spent
          debating whether the merits of each such repository warrant their
          being mentioned.</li>
      <li>Steve asked for confirmation that, assuming an additional registry,
          that a single text encoding ID is still needed.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that the IANA ID is an enum class and that, in
          principle, multiple such classes are possible.</li>
      <li>Steve stated that renaming <tt>mib()</tt> to <tt>iana_mib()</tt>
          results in the feature no longer being generic.</li>
      <li>Jens agreed.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that code written for P1885 today that consults
          <tt>mib()</tt> is necessarily concerned with IANA specifically.</li>
      <li>Steve asked what function a generic library should call then.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that, if the IANA ID is desired, then call
          <tt>mib()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that, since multiple encodings may map to IANA's "other",
          reliance on <tt>mib()</tt> to uniquely identify an encoding is not
          possible.</li>
      <li>Hubert opined that the proposed renames are fine, but that
          extension to other registries might require different
          terminology.</li>
      <li>Jens offered examples such as "unique ID" and "UUID".</li>
      <li>Jens opined that it doesn't hurt to add "iana" to make the
          terminology association explicit.</li>
      <li>Hubert agreed.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that, for wide encodings, there are some registries
          that are somewhat suitable; in CDRA, wide encodings aren't explicitly
          represented as they constitute a composition of a character set and
          an encoding.</li>
      <li>PBrett acknowledged and noted that the proposal is intended to clear
          design space for extension for such cases.</li>
      <li>Tom provided some arguments in favor of support for multiple
          registries:
        <ul>
          <li>As previously noted, the IANA specification is goverened by an
              organization that some have concerns about.</li>
          <li>The IANA registry is poor from a quality of specification
              perspective.</li>
          <li>The IANA registry is missing entries that are found in other
              registries.</li>
          <li>The same name is sometimes used by different registries to refer
              to differenc encodings.</li>
          <li>Other registries are arguably more suitable for some environments;
              e.g., CDRA for IBM environments.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Tom suggested that the proposal replace the P1885 proposed exposition
          only data members with post conditions on the default constructor to
          require <tt>iana_mib()</tt> and <tt>name()</tt> to return
          <tt>id::other</tt> and an empty string respectively; this is to avoid
          encouraging implementations to simply store an IANA ID.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted that much of the current wording is in terms of the
          <tt>mib_</tt> exposition only data member.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that those can be changed to <tt>mib()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Jens pointed out that the following text from the proposed wording
          creates the impression that the specified feature provides a remote
          API interface.
        <ul>
          <li>"[text.encoding] describes an interface for accessing the IANA
              Character Sets registry".</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Jens stated that <tt>text_encoding</tt> currently containes a list of
          all encodings in the IANA registry and that this proposal makes the
          <tt>text_encoding</tt> class more of a first class entity for which
          mapping to other registries is ancillary functionality.</li>
      <li>Jens opined that this direction suggests the need to create our own
          encoding registry since the functionality effectively defines
          one.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that such a change constitutes a change in direction that
          is more significant than the proposed renames suggest.</li>
      <li>PBrett acknowledged that the proposal makes the design more abstract
          in a manner similar to how Unicode specifies abstract characters.</li>
      <li>PBrett added that he could imagine a C++ appendix that lists the
          encodings, but that would then necessitate defining them.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that a registration service could be established, but did
          not advise doing so.</li>
      <li>Jens observed that discussion has not yet reached the bottom of how
          encodings would be mapped between encodings registered with different
          registries.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested the possibility of defining an
          <tt>iana_text_encoding</tt> class and later adding an
          <tt>iso_text_encoding</tt> class or similar for other registries if
          warranted.</li>
      <li>Hubert observed that the P1885 design contains the same mapping
          problem since it presents a single domain, but doesn't adhere solely
          to that domain.</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested the possibility of a <tt>text_encoding</tt> class
          template parameterized by a registry identifier.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that, if one were to map the encodings present in the
          <a href="https://icu4c-demos.unicode.org/icu-bin/convexp">ICU converter explorer</a>,
          then parameterization by registry is necessary due to conflicting
          use of the same name for different encodings.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: For example, "korean" maps to "windows-949-2000"
          via the "Windows" provider, but to "ibm-1363_P11B-1998" via the "IANA"
          provider. ]</em></li>
      <li>PBrett reiterated the intent of this proposal; to remove complete
          dependency on IANA.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that the proposed change is consistent with the P1885
          direction given that comparison is dependent on name when an encoding
          maps to IANA's "other".</li>
      <li>Tom opined that there is no need to specify a mapping between
          repositories in the standard; the mapping can be
          implementation-defined.</li>
      <li>Jens agreed that leaving the mapping implementation-defined is
          possible but felt an obligation to specify the mapping.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that, for implementors, the concern is what is in the
          interest of their users.</li>
      <li>PBrett expressed a belief that creation of a character encoding
          registry service would be outside the scope of WG21 work, but that he
          would be willing to assist with such an effort outside of WG21.</li>
      <li>Jens agreed and noted that such a service would essentially be
          attending to graves.</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested that <tt>text_encoding</tt> may be more appropriate
          as a concept.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that distinct classes or class template specializations
          for each registry would create friction at interface boundaries.</li>
      <li>Hubert responded that a type erased interface could still be
          specified.</li>
      <li>PBrett expressed being open to other suggestions.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested renaming the current <tt>text_encoding</tt> class to
          <tt>iana_text_encoding</tt> and, if motivation arises for another
          registry, then a new class can be added.</li>
      <li>General discussion ensued regarding the ramification of distinct
          classes.</li>
      <li>Tom pondered what name would be returned by <tt>name()</tt> if
          multiple registries are supported.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that his proposal intended to avoid that
          question.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tom stated that the next telecon will be held on 2022-01-26 and that the
      agenda will include:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p2286r5">P2286R5 (formatting ranges)</a>,</li>
      <li>the LWG issues concerning <tt>std::format</tt> fill characters,

<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Tom informed the group of tentative plans for a SSRG and SG16 joint
      telecon to discuss the security aspects of
      <a href="https://wg21.link/p2528r0">P2528R0 (C++ Identifier Security using Unicode Standard Annex 39)</a>
      and asked for feedback or concerns about such a meeting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p2286r6">P2286R6: Formatting Ranges</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>Tom informed the group that Barry was unable to be in attendance but
          that we are ok to discuss the wording and gather feedback for
          him.</li>
      <li>Victor explained that he had assisted with the wording related to
          escape handling, but that Barry authored the rest.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that it is generally not advised to discuss a paper
          without the author present.</li>
      <li>Tom acknowledged the guidance and reported that he had communicated
          with Barry and that Barry was content with Victor being present to
          discuss any issues that are raised.</li>
      <li>Jens asked for confirmation that LEWG has already approved the
          design.</li>
      <li>Victor responded that the paper is present in the currently active
          electronic polling cycle.</li>
      <li>Victor shared the paper and reviewed the revision history.</li>
      <li>Victor began reviewing the wording.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked if the <tt>formattable</tt> concept has semantic
          constraints that cannot be expressed in the concept definition.</li>
      <li>Victor replied that it does not.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that, in section 5.1 of the paper, [format.formattable]
          paragraph 2 states the semantic requirements.</li>
      <li>Zach asked if the concept has been implemented as specified.</li>
      <li>Victor expressed uncertainty regarding the concept definition, but
          assured the group that the rest of the design has been
          implemented.</li>
      <li>Mark asked, with regard to section 5.2, why '?' appears as a
          type.</li>
      <li>Victor explained a requirement for mutual exclusivity.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked if there is intent to standardize the use of '?' to
          enable a debug representation generally; e.g., for non-standard
          types.</li>
      <li>Victor replied that doing so is outside the scope of the standard,
          but expressed support for that direction.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted that the paper introduces a <tt>set_debug_format()</tt>
          member function and asked if it would be desirable to add generic
          support for invoking it.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that the parser for the formatted type would presumably
          have to be responsible for recognizing the '?' character and invoking
          the member function.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that calls to <tt>set_debug_format()</tt> must activate
          the debug format regardless of whether a '?' is present in the format
          string.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested that adding generic facilities to support the '?'
          specifier would be ok, but probably best addressed by a different
          paper.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that, in the proposed wording for
          [format.string.escaped], subparagraph 2.4.1, that the "Other" ("C")
          value of <tt>General_Category</tt> is an abbreviation for a set of
          categories and requested that the wording specify the individual
          categories.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: The values for <tt>General_Category</tt> are
          specified in
          <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/tr44-28.html#General_Category_Values">table 12 of section 5.7.1 of Unicode 14 UAX#44</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: The wording also refers to the
          <tt>General_Category</tt> value of "Separator" ("Z") that is likewise
          an abbreviation for a set of categories and should presumably be
          expanded as well. ]</em></li>
      <li>Hubert noted that format stability cannot be guaranteed and that
          output will change when newer Unicode standards are adopted.</li>
      <li>Tom asked for confirmation that stability will only be lacking for
          currently unassigned characters.</li>
      <li>Steve replied that this should be further researched and noted that
          the "Unassigned" ("Cn") property is not stable.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that the wording does not address non-Unicode text and
          asked if <tt>isprint()</tt> and <tt>iswprint()</tt> should be used to
          identify non-printable characters in those cases.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that doing so warrants further discussion.</li>
      <li>Hubert pondered whether it would be preferable to map non-Unicode
          characters to Unicode and then proceed with using the Unicode
          character properties.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that, for implementations that support user defined
          encodings, the implementation may not know how to map to Unicode.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that such user defined definitions must define
          categories to be used for <tt>isprint()</tt> and other character
          classification functions, but acknowledged that a mapping to Unicode
          may not be present.</li>
      <li>PBrett stated that [format.string.escaped] paragraph 2 does not state
          how to determine if the string to be escaped is in a Unicode
          encoding.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted that he believes such wording to be present in the
          wording related to field width and suggested it may be desirable to
          generalize that and move it to a central location.</li>
      <li>Steve asked if the determination might be locale dependent.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted that previous guidance was that <tt>std::format()</tt>
          may be used for binary data and that any associated encoding is
          therefore tenuous.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested that, in those cases, a programmer might be advised
          not to use the '?' formatting type.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested it may be reasonable to, again, use the literal
          encoding as a proxy for the potentially locale dependent
          encoding.</li>
      <li>Victor agreed.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that, for the non-Unicode case, determining
          printability would require either locale dependence or preservation
          of the compile-time literal encoding.</li>
      <li>Charlie noted that, historically, the latter would have been
          difficult and that, for Microsoft, the active code page (ACP) was
          used in the past.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that, in a cross-compilation scenario, it is possible
          that the literal encoding is not a defined encoding for the target
          environment.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested that, at some point, we will need to poll whether the
          non-Unicode behavior should be locale dependent or not.</li>
      <li>Hubert expressed acceptance of non-locale dependent behavior for the
          non-Unicode case so long as there is no requirement to match the
          behavior for the Unicode case with regard to emitting hex vs UCN
          notation.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that, if locale dependence is avoided, it will be
          necessary to assume an encoding for characters that are not
          consistently encoded for all locales; like '\' in EBCDIC
          environments.</li>
      <li>Hubert added that doing so might be ok if the choice is determined
          by the literal encoding.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested it may be useful to support opt-in to locale
          dependence via the 'L' modifier.</li>
      <li>Victor stated that the 'L' modifier could be reserved for now.</li>
      <li>Mark noted that the 'L' modifier is currently supported for character
          type.</li>
      <li>Jens pointed out that the changes to [format.formatter.spec]
          paragraph 2 appear to indicate that a declaration of the
          <tt>set_debug_format()</tt> member function in any one of the
          specializations will affect all of them.</li>
      <li>Victor agreed that this wording requires more work.</li>
      <li>Mark asked when a formatter object for which
          <tt>set_debug_format()</tt> was called is reset or what happens when
          the '?' specifier is not applicable to the type.</li>
      <li>Victor replied that it should be an error to specify mutually
          exclusive options or that the last option overrides prior ones but
          that further consideration is required.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that the order of the interior bullets in
          [format.string.escaped] subparagraph 2.2 need to be revised to
          address two issues:
        <ol>
          <li>The algorithm must process the contents of string <tt>S</tt> in
              order.</li>
          <li><tt>S</tt> consists of a sequence of code units, not UCS scalar
              values.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Jens suggested trying to factor out the code unit and UCS scalar
          value cases to avoid the exceptions.</li>
      <li>Charlie stated that the handling of invalid code unit sequences needs
          to be specified since recovery may not always be possible; failure to
          recover could result in output containing a long sequence of values
          in hex notation.</li>
      <li>Jens acknowledged the scenario and agreed that the specification must
          be made clear about that.</li>
      <li>Jens asked what "universal character name escape sequence" is intended
          to mean in [format.string.escaped] subparagraph 2.4.2 and noted that a
          definition does not exist for "universal character name" though one
          does exist for <em>universal-character-name</em>.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that this wording probably should not refer to
          <em>universal-character-name</em> since it describes a grammar
          nonterminal and suggested replacing
          "its universal character name escape sequence" with
          "a sequence of scalar values".</li>
      <li>PBrett agreed.</li>
      <li>Steve pointed out that similar uses of grammar nonterminals appear in
          the wording.</li>
      <li>Jens agreed and suggested that the various "escape sequence" uses
          should be replaced with "a sequence of scalar values in the form
          ...".</li>
      <li>Jens pointed out a grammar issue in the first line of
          [format.string.escaped] paragraph 3;
          "... is equivalent to the escaped string representation a string
          of <tt>C</tt> ...".</li>
      <li>Hubert requested that a note be added to [format.string.escaped]
          paragraph 4 to indicate that behavior is not locale dependent but
          that the encoding may be informed by the literal encoding.</li>
      <li>Jens reported that the expected output noted in the comment for
          example <tt>s3</tt> in [format.string.escaped] paragraph 4 is
          incorrect; there should be two ranges and therefore two sets of
          brackets.</li>
      <li>Tom observed that the examples that follow [format.string.escaped]
          paragraph 4 depict the expected Unicode behavior, but appear to be
          part of paragraph 4 which is specific to non-Unicode behavior.</li>
      <li>Victor agreed there is a presentation issue that needs to be
          addressed there.</li>
      <li>Jens advised moving paragraphs 2 through 6 of [format.range] after
          the <tt>range_formatter</tt> class definition.</li>
      <li>Victor noted that "exposition only" should appear in italics.</li>
      <li>Mark asked why, in the last row of the table associated with
          [format.range] paragraph 6, "?s" is required as opposed to just
          "?".</li>
      <li>PBrett stated that requiring "?s" is inconsistent with the string
          case where "?" can be specified by itself.</li>
      <li>Victor explained that "s" indicates that a range is intended to be
          formatted as a string; "?s" is therefore needed to format the range
          as a string in debug mode.</li>
      <li>PBrett pointed out the "this is equivalent to invoking
          set_brackets({}, {})" note in [format.range] paragraph 5 and asked
          if a programmer is permitted to make such a call.</li>
      <li>Victor replied that the wording is intended for implementors.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked if, when implementing a range formatter, whether it is
          required to implement member functions like
          <tt>set_brackets()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Victor replied that LEWG had discussed this and that the member
          functions are intended to help avoid ABI issues.</li>
      <li>Mark asked if <tt>set_separator()</tt> and <tt>set_brackets()</tt>
          should be restricted to characters and how characters outside the
          basic character set need to be handled in various scenarios such as
          applicability to estimated field width determination.</li>
      <li>Victor replied that the functions accept strings as input.</li>
      <li>Tom reviewed the list of previously discussed design points that were
          noted in the
          <a href="https://lists.isocpp.org/sg16/2022/01/2956.php">email announcing the agenda for the telecon</a>.</li>
      <li>Tom noted the need for wording to address recovery from encoding
          errors.</li>
      <li>Charlie stated that recovery should follow the processes described in
          the
          <a href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org">WHATWG Encoding Standard</a>.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: See
          <a href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#encoders-and-decoders">section 4.1, "Encoders and decoders"</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>Tom noted the need to ensure that <tt>std::filesystem::path</tt> is
          rejected as a formattable range.</li>
      <li>Victor replied that it is rejected by the constraints on the
          <tt>formatter</tt> partial specialization specified in the
          [format.syn] updates; those constraints reject recursive ranges.</li>
      <li>Victor suggested it might be helpful to add a note that
          <tt>std::filesystem::path</tt> is rejected there.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tom announced that the next telecon will be February 9th.</li>

<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p2498r1">P2498R1: Forward compatibility of text_encoding with additional encoding registries</a>
    <ul>
      <li>PBrett presented:
        <ul>
          <li>The R0 revision was reviewed by SG16 a few weeks ago.</li>
          <li>The R1 revision rebases the wording on the latest P1885
              revision.</li>
          <li>The wording was reworked to decouple IANA IDs from the
              exposition only data members.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Victor noticed an unnecessary trailing semicolon following the
          closing brace of the <tt>std</tt> namespace declaration in the
          proposed updates to [text.encoding].</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that Corentin's recently added response to P2498R1 in
          <a href="https://wg21.link/p1885r10">P1885R10</a>
          noted unnecessary use of an enum for the proposed internal details of
          the <tt>text_encoding</tt> class and asked if it was necessary for it
          to be an enum.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that it is exposition only.</li>
      <li>Jens pointed out an existing <tt>using enum id</tt> declaration in
          the <tt>text_encoding</tt> synopsis that should presumably have been
          changed to <tt>using enum iana_id</tt>.</li>
      <li>Jens noted similar renaming updates needed in the postcondition for
          the <tt>text_encoding(iana_id)</tt> constructor where comparisons
          against <tt>id::unknown</tt> and <tt>id::other</tt> are currently
          present.</li>
      <li>Jens observed that the <tt>text_encoding(iana_id)</tt> constructor
          does not state that its argument is stored.</li>
      <li>PBrett explained that such storage is implied by the postcondition
          requirements on the result of calls to <tt>iana_mib()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested that there should be some wording that relates the
          exposition only <tt>id</tt> type to <tt>iana_id</tt>.</li>
      <li>PBrett agreed that could be better specified.</li>
      <li>PBrett indicated that some positive guidance is needed before
          spending further effort on this proposal.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested polling support for the concerns the paper purports to
          address.</li>
      <li>Discussion regarding polls ensued.</li>
      <li><b>Poll 1A: It should be more explicit in the identifiers used by the

          the telecon. The agenda and links used here reference P2513R1 since
          the links to the draft paper were ephemeral.  The published document
          may differ from the reviewed draft revision. ]</em></li>
      <li>JeanHeyd presented:
        <ul>
          <li>The <tt>char8_t</tt> related changes in C++20 made it more
              difficult to write code that works in both C and C++.</li>
          <li>The proposal is intended to improve compatibility with C.</li>
          <li>The proposal provides an escape hatch in C++ to restore some uses
              of UTF-8 string literals with <tt>char</tt>, <tt>signed char</tt>,
              and <tt>unsigned char</tt>.</li>
          <li>The proposal only relaxes array initialization; pointer behavior
              is not changed.</li>
          <li>The changes are intended as a DR against C++20 so that common
              code can be written for C++17, C++20, C++23, and C.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Victor stated that relaxing initialization for arrays but not for
          pointers creates an inconsistency and that he prefers an error.</li>
      <li>Victor added that <tt>signed char</tt> and <tt>unsigned char</tt> are
          commonly used for <tt>int8_t</tt> and <tt>uint8_t</tt> and the
          proposed changes would allow arrays of these types to now be
          initialized by UTF-8 string literals.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd acknowledged this would be the case and is consistent with
          C++11 through C++17.</li>
      <li>Hubert presented a backward compatibilty concern involving overload
          resolution and initialization of parameters of aggregate type using
          list initialization syntax; the following example is well-formed in
          C++20, but would become ill-formed with the proposed change.
<pre style="display:inline"><tt>
  struct A { char8_t s[5]; };
  struct B { char s[5]; };
  void f(A);
  void f(B);
  void foo() {
    f({u8"text"}); // Resolves to f(A) in C++20, ambiguous with the proposed changes.
  }
</tt></pre>
      </li>
      <li>PBrett observed that the overload resolution issue currently exists
          with <tt>signed char</tt> and <tt>unsigned char</tt>.</li>
      <li>Tom asked for confirmation that binding to a reference to an array
          would still be ill-formed.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd replied affirmatively.</li>
      <li>Jens explained that there is an existing special case that permits
          initialization of arrays of <tt>signed char</tt> or
          <tt>unsigned char</tt> by an ordinary string literal.</li>
      <li>PBrett summarized; the overload scenario already exists for
          <tt>char</tt>, <tt>signed char</tt>, and <tt>unsigned char</tt>.</li>
      <li>Jens agreed and suggested adding an annex C entry with the above
          example to note the new ambiguity.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd reviewed the wording.
        <ul>
          <li>The value of the <tt>__cpp_char8_t</tt> feature test macro is
              updated.</li>
          <li>The subsitution of "may" for "can" in [dcl.init.string] is a
              drive by fix done to maintain consistency with the other changes
              to the paragraph.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>JeanHeyd noted that, with the changes, a program that passes a UTF-8
          string literal as an argument for a function parameter of type
          <tt>const char*</tt> remains ill-formed.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd stated that the ability to initialize <tt>char</tt>-based
          arrays with a UTF-8 string literal addresses constexpr concerns in a
          much simpler way than is presented in
          <a href="https://wg21.link/p1423r3">P1423R3 (char8_t backward compatibility remediation)</a>.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked if any consideration was given for addressing these
          concerns with a core issue.</li>
      <li>JeanHeyd replied that a core issue wouldn't be appropriate since the
          C++20 changes were deliberate.</li>
      <li>Tom agreed and noted that this aspect of the C++20 changes was
          approved by EWG.</li>
      <li>Jens agreed that a core issue is unlikely to be helpful, especially
          since a paper already exists.</li>
      <li>Jens asserted that EWG should review and, as a DR, this can be
          considered after C++23 feature freeze.</li>
      <li>Hubert observed that the backward compatibility impact to overload
          resolution can be avoided by limiting the allowance to variables of
          array type.</li>
      <li>Jens agreed, but noted that would require more careful
          wordsmithing.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Tom reminded the group about the upcoming SSRG meeting on Monday,
      February 28th, and encouraged the contribution of suggested improvements
      for
      <a href="https://wg21.link/p2528">P2528R0 (C++ Identifier Security using Unicode Standard Annex 39)</a>
      to the author.</li>
  <li>Discuss objectives and priorities for C++26:
    <ul>
      <li>Tom asked the group for suggestions on what we should focus on for
          C++26.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested alias barriers as a remaining core language feature
          improvement.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: See
          <a href="https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16/issues/67">SG16 issue #67</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>PBrett suggested improvements for access to command line options and
          environment variables.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: See
          <a href="https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16/issues/66">SG16 issue #66</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>Jens noted the existing practice for the <tt>_wmain()</tt> entry
          point in Microsoft Visual C++.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted the <tt>envp</tt> parameter that POSIX adds to
          <tt>main()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested <tt>std::rope</tt> for chained text segments.</li>
      <li>Steve suggested transcoding and lamented JeanHeyd's absence.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested an owning string type that eschews null
          termination.</li>
      <li>Charles expressed concern that a string type that doesn't ensure
          null termination may not improve security due to programmers
          attempting to pass such data to functions that require a null
          terminated string anyway.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested that implicit conversions could be prohibited.</li>
      <li>Steve noted the usability challenges such prohibition creates.</li>
      <li>Victor stated that programmers will misuse such types even if
          implicit conversions are not supported; they will assume that, for
          example, a <tt>data()</tt> member function will provide a null
          terminated string.</li>
      <li>PBrett replied that such concerns apply to the existing
          <tt>std::string_view</tt> type as well.</li>
      <li>PBrett asserted there is room for a <tt>std::string_view</tt> like
          type that owns the string data.</li>
      <li>Charles noted that having to pass a string held in such a type to a
          function that requires null termination would require having to copy
          the string contents just to add a null terminator and lamented the
          cost of such copies.</li>
      <li>Jens asked PBrett what other features he might like to see in a new
          string type.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that he would mostly like to not have to write yet
          more string types that avoid null termination concerns.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested that a string type that helps to avoid allocation and
          deallocation costs could be beneficial.</li>
      <li>Jens stated he would prefer not to spend time in SG16 on general
          data structures.</li>
      <li>Jens asserted that the elephant in the room is ICU and the
          functionality it provides and expressed a desire for a roadmap
          towards providing similar functionality.</li>
      <li>Steve suggested that PBrett publish a paper extolling the benefits
          of a string type without null termination.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that benefits appear when working with databases
          and graphics.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that, if a new string type were to materialize, he would
          like to know for sure what encoding it is intended to be used
          with.</li>
      <li>PBrett offered two categories of such encoding assurances:
          1) a type intended for text with an assumed encoding, and
          2) a type that enforces well-formed encoding.</li>
      <li>Steve offered a third category:
          3) a type that maintains invariants like normalization form.</li>
      <li>Steve reported having to investigate problems due to assumption of
          UTF-8 leading to errors when data was passed to Python programs
          that enforced well-formedness.</li>
      <li>Steve stated that Bloomberg is strongly in favor of a type that
          maintains such invariants.</li>
      <li>Charles expressed desire for a way to pass a filename on the command
          line that is preserved.</li>
      <li>Charles explained that this currently isn't possible on Windows due
          to transcoding that occurs when preparing a command line to pass to
          <tt>main()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Tom asked if it is possible to enter such names on the command line
          from Windows shells in the first place, but acknowledged it can be
          done from <tt>CreateProcess()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Charles replied that tab completion and similar shell features can
          produce such names.</li>
      <li>Tom asked to confirm that this should be considered a language issue
          as opposed to a shell issue.</li>
      <li>Charles explained that other languages provide such mechanisms and
          noted that Rust has an <tt>OsString</tt> type that stores WTF-8 on
          Windows.</li>
      <li>PBrett added that Rust is a good example of a language that provides
          strings that don't guarantee null termination.</li>
      <li>Tom returned to discussion about features to focus on and suggested
          Unicode algorithms.</li>
      <li>Hubert asked if ICU provides message formatting features.</li>
      <li>Tom confirmed that it does.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted the work that the Message Format Working Group (MFWG)
          is doing.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: The MFWG tracks its work
          <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg">here</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>Tom suggested improved support for regular expressions as another
          feature to work on.</li>
      <li>Charles replied that such work depends on whether the committee is
          willing to standardize a <tt>std::regex2</tt> or similar.</li>
      <li>Charles stated that a new regex design would presumably face the
          same challenges that <tt>std::regex</tt> did and may therefore
          produce a similarly poor result.</li>
      <li>Charles noted that regular expression support is a feature for which
          interoperability across libraries is not often needed.</li>
      <li>PBrett asserted that a standard regex facility is beneficial because
          general programmers aren't particularly good at writing their
          own.</li>
      <li>Charles suggested that a class intended to be used as a base class
          for string buffer management could be beneficial for building
          parsers; particularly a type that provides interfaces to peek ahead
          and push back.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested a <tt>std::lexy</tt> with reference to
          Jonathan Müller's work.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: Jonathan's Lexy work is published
          <a href="https://lexy.foonathan.net">here</a>. ]</em></li>
      <li>Tom asked if the work done on <tt>std::format</tt> provides a
          precedent for how to design a <tt>std::regex</tt> replacement that
          would be more isolated from ABI concerns.</li>
      <li>Charles responded that <tt>std::format</tt> is fairly exposed to ABI
          concerns, but acknowledged the possibility of designing a more
          isolated type.</li>
      <li>Victor stated that Hana Dusíková's CTRE provides a good example of
          how to write parsers.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: Hana's CTRE work is published
          <a href="https://compile-time-regular-expressions.readthedocs.io/en/latest">here</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>PBrett asked about ideas for how to be more explicit about
          associating an encoding with existing text; e.g., how to have text
          in UTF-8 and pass it to something that requires UTF-16.</li>
      <li>Steve asked if anyone recalled a proposal that would allow
          specifically binding to a string literal.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that he did not but noted that a user-defined literal
          (UDL) can provide similar functionality.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: Tom was thinking of something like this:</em>
<pre style="display:inline"><tt>
  #include &lt;cstddef&gt;
  class string_literal {
  private:
      const char *p;
      string_literal(const char *p) : p(p) {}
  public:
      const char* data() const { return p; }
      friend string_literal operator ""sl(const char *p, std::size_t);
  };
  string_literal operator ""sl(const char *p, std::size_t) {
      return string_literal(p);
  }
  void f(const char*);
  void g(string_literal sl) {
      f(sl.data());
  }
  void h() {
      g("hello"sl);
  }
</tt></pre>
        <em>]</em></li>
      <li>Steve stated that a facility that allows associating a dynamic
          encoding would be useful for scenarios in which the text and its
          associated encoding are not known at compile time.</li>
      <li>Victor noted that encodings are often properties of interfaces and
          suggested that an attribute based approach to specifying encoding
          expecations could be helpful; this would allow specifying
          expectations that are dependent on locale or Windows Active Code
          Page (ACP).</li>
      <li>Charles expressed support for that approach.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked what the advantage of an attribute would be.</li>
      <li>Victor replied that it could be added to existing functions without
          ABI impact.</li>
      <li>Charles observed that, if the <tt>#embed</tt> is adopted, then text
          that is not in the literal encoding might be imported.</li>
      <li>Hubert responded that the <tt>#embed</tt> author has been clear that
          the proposal is intended to provide binary resources.</li>
      <li>Tom changed topics by asking for suggestions regarding how to solicit
          new SG16 attendees and reported that he and Peter had previously
          discussed inviting other WG21 members to share what the organizations
          they work with do in practice.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that backward compatibility and existing practice
          are motivation for not providing new facilities.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested that, if someone were to come forward with a
          proposal to adopt a suite of string types similar to those provided
          by Rust, that we might tell them no thank you.</li>
      <li>PBrett stated that we should, of course, discuss any proposals that
          come before us.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that seems to argue for the status quo plus what people
          actually do.</li>
      <li>Jens expressed belief that there is good opportunity to make progress
          with small improvements and provided a UTF-8 decoding iterator as an
          example.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that an existing proposal covers such iterators.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: See
          <a href="https://wg21.link/p0244">P0244 (Text_view: A C++ concepts and range based character encoding and code point enumeration library)</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>Charles responded that he has written a grapheme iterator.</li>
      <li>Charles noted that such iterators are always going to be slower than
          bulk conversion routines.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested adding locale-independent replacements for character
          classification functions like <tt>isdigit()</tt>; e.g.,
          <tt>is_ascii_digit()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Charles expressed support for such locale invariant functions and
          noted via chat that glib provides such a variant named
          <tt>g_ascii_isdigit()</tt>.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that there is a distinction; locale-independent variants
          would operate using an implementation-defined encoding where as ASCII
          variants would operate using ASCII even in an EBCDIC environment.</li>
      <li>Hubert asked if anyone would object to having both variants; e.g., a
          locale-independent variant that always operates using the "C" locale
          and an ASCII variant.</li>
      <li>No objections were raised.</li>
      <li>PBrett stated that the highest priority item should be transcoding
          facilities.</li>
      <li>Jens asked if he meant something like <tt>iconv()</tt>.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that he meant something more like JeanHeyd Meneide's
          <tt>ztd::text</tt>.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: JeanHeyd's <tt>ztd::text</tt> work is published
          <a href="https://ztdtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest">here</a>.
          ]</em></li>
      <li>Charles stated that, with regard to providing an ICU interface in
          the standard, there are performance implications; support for generic
          iterators would warrant availability of definitions for inlining
          purposes.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked if anyone could comment regarding the utility of
          <tt>std::message</tt>.</li>
      <li>Steve responded that the main problem with message catalogs is that
          they don't tend to work well with real languages.</li>
      <li>PBrett reported having good experience with GNU gettext, but that it
          required discipline to be used successfully.</li>
      <li>PBrett stated that the other elephant in the room is locale, but
          noted that <tt>std::format()</tt> provides a foundation we can build
          on.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested the possibility of enabling thread-specific locale
          facilities that avoid reliance on a global locale.</li>
      <li>PBrett suggested a review of all locale dependent interfaces followed
          by a proposal that adds variants that accept a locale as an
          argument.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that C already does that and that all C++ interfaces use
          <tt>std::locale</tt>.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that POSIX provides a thread aware locale interface
          that enables changing locale for a specific thread as well as
          interfaces that accept a locale argument.</li>
      <li>PBrett provided an example; a <tt>std::isalpha()</tt> overload that
          accepts a <tt>std::locale</tt> argument.</li>
      <li>Hubert responded that POSIX specifies a <tt>isalpha_l()</tt>
          interface that accepts a <tt>locale_t</tt> argument.</li>
      <li>Tom asked if <tt>std::locale</tt> is fundamentally problematic or
          whether the problems we face with it are isolated to the facets.</li>
      <li>PBrett responded that it has fundamental limitations due to reliance
          on inheritance.</li>
      <li>Victor stated that the facet's assumption that characters fit in a
          code unit is the most significant problem.</li>
      <li>Victor added that <tt>std::locale</tt> uses reference counting and
          therefore has a performance profile similar to a shared pointer.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that <tt>std::locale</tt> strongly ties C++
          implementations to the suite of C locales since the interface depends
          on the names of C locales; it is therefore questionable how
          implementors might provide more generic locale support.</li>
      <li>Steve stated that WG14 recently adopted a proposal that adds
          '@', '$', and '`' to the basic source character set.</li>
      <li>Steve added that he intends to bring a matching paper to WG21 in the
          near future.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: The adopted WG14 proposal is
          <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2701.htm">N2701</a>.

  <li>Tom announced that the next meeting will be on March 9th and, unless a
      new paper materializes, will likely focus on diving deeper into one of
      the topics discussed today.</li>

<h1 id="2022_03_09">March 9th, 2022</h1>

<h2>Draft agenda:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>ICU features to consider for C++26</li>
</ul>

<h2>Attendees:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Charlie Barto</li>
  <li>Hubert Tong</li>
  <li>Jens Maurer</li>
  <li>Peter Brett</li>
  <li>Steve Downey</li>
  <li>Tom Honermann</li>
</ul>

<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Tom introduced the topic:
    <ul>
      <li>Tom was inspired by Jens' assertion during the previous telecon that
          "the elephant in the room is ICU and the functionality it
          provides".</li>
      <li>Based on that, Tom created a
          <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f-CLhYZIf_L0q1QBEqe2sVHyAofGx8Akt_xJKDGhcgA/edit?usp=sharing">Google Doc</a>
          containing a list of ICU feature categories annotated with Tom's
          opinions on whether such features are worthy of consideration for
          standardization in C++26 should suitable proposals materialize.</li>
      <li>Tom would like to issue a Call for Papers covering the features we
          agree are worth consideration.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tom began reviewing the feature categories in the order they appear in
      the document.</li>
  <li>The categories enumerated below are those for which there were material
      comments.</li>
  <li>"Unicode character properties":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom pondered the benefits of exposing the set of raw UCD properties
          as opposed to just those that are needed for other features.</li>
      <li>Charles responded that there are representation choices to be made
          based on usage.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that support for segmentation requires many of the UCD
          properties.</li>
      <li>Steve stated that it would be useful to expose all of the properties
          to enable experimentation.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that, if there are design problems with how the data is
          exposed, that would be useful information.</li>
      <li>PBrett observed that the UCD properties are needed to implement
          proper internationalization and localization support.</li>
      <li>PBrett pondered whether exposing all UCD properties might create
          portability issues.</li>
      <li>Tom asked if it might be reasonable to only expose properties with
          stability guarantees.</li>
      <li>Steve replied that doing so probably would not be viable; some
          properties required for segmentation are not stable and there is a
          need to be able to fix things.</li>
      <li>Tom noted the difference between data being stable as compared to
          property shapes being stable.</li>
      <li>Steve acknowledged and noted that property shapes haven't changed
          in a while.</li>
      <li>Steve added that the ICU maintainers would presumably push back hard
          if Unicode made significant changes to the shape of existing
          properties.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Sets of Unicode Code Points and Strings":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom commented that the items in this category appear to be simple
          utilities.</li>
      <li>PBrett opined that may be a good reason to provide them.</li>
      <li>Tom observed that they appear to be used to provide support for
          character classes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Locales":
    <ul>
      <li>PBrett stated that one of the challenges with locale identifiers is
          that choice of locale is not fixed at compile-time.</li>
      <li>PBrett added that locale IDs are subject to geopolitical changes.</li>
      <li>Steve reported that there has been much work on client-side
          localization through
          <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-402/">ECMA 402</a>,
          and
          <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x">ICU4X</a>.</li>
      <li>Steve expressed caution over trying to standardize something like
          ECMA 401 and ICU4X given that they are recent developments.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that client side support uses browser based
          facilities.</li>
      <li>PBrett wondered if C++ code compiled to WASM should transparently
          proxy to the local environment.</li>
      <li>Tom asked whether new locale support could be built on
          <tt>std::locale</tt>, perhaps via new facets.</li>
      <li>Hubert objected to such support built on new <tt>std::locale</tt>
          facets due to <tt>std::locale</tt> being dependent on C locale
          names.</li>
      <li>PBrett replied that it would be useful to be able to get an ISO
          locale name from a standard locale.</li>
      <li>Hubert noted that encoding information would be lost in that
          case.</li>
      <li>PBrett agreed and asserted that encoding ideally wouldn't be a
          locale concern anyway.</li>
      <li>Hubert replied that a particular script could be implied by
          <tt>std::locale</tt>.</li>
      <li>Steve observed that we seem to be in agreement that we don't know
          how to do this today.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that the problem is that proper case mapping, case
          folding, and collation can't be provided without proper locale
          support.</li>
      <li>PBrett agreed and asserted the need for a plan to improve locale
          support.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Resource Bundles":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom suggested that this feature could be built on top of features
          like <tt>#embed</tt> and support for dynamic libraries; perhaps a
          downstream feature then.</li>
      <li>Charles noted that Microsoft style resource management can be
          provided on other platforms using linker scripts.</li>
      <li>PBrett opined that resources are a requirement for a good locale
          system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Calendars and Time Zones" and "Date and Time Formatting":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom stated that base facilities exist that could be expanded, but
          that there are locale dependenices.</li>
      <li>PBrett acknowledged concerns raised by Corentin on the mailing list
          that noted that the existing facilities are not at parity with the
          ICU features.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Message Formatting":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom stated that this is awaiting further developments from the
          <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg">Message Format Working Group (MFWG)</a>.</li>
      <li>PBrett commented that, what programmers want and what they need are
          not always the same thing.</li>
      <li>Charles expressed a desire for experience outside the standard before
          pursuing support in the standard; even more so for this feature than
          for other ones.</li>
      <li>Charles added that, ideally, a production quality application would
          be built on top of such a facility; one that has users using it from
          multiple locales.</li>
      <li>PBrett opined that <tt>std::format()</tt> may not provide a great
          base to build this on.</li>
      <li>Charles replied that it is probably usable, but not sufficient as
          is.</li>
      <li>Tom stated there would presumably be a need to pass a message ID in
          place of a format string.</li>
      <li>Charles reported that could be done using
          <tt>std::vformat()</tt>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Text Transformation":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom suggested that, if there is a specific transliteration that we
          have motivation to provide, then we can do so; range adapters
          provide general support for this otherwise.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that JeanHeyd's
          <a href="https://ztdtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest">ztd.text</a>
          library can do some of this.</li>
      <li>Hubert asked if this feature category is referring to technical
          transliteration or linguistic transliteration.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that he did not know.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Bidirectional Algorithm":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom asked for confirmation that this does not have locale
          dependencies and is effectively about state management for layout
          purposes.</li>
      <li>Steve replied that the algorithm is complicated as it tries to
          support all possible scenarios.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Collation":
    <ul>
      <li>Jens described a design possibility involving locale independent
          base functionality that operates on a set of locale dependent
          collation rules.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that the rules engine would have to be sufficient to
          perform all tasks required by all locales.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that such a facility could be useful as a building block
          for locale support and as a standalone facility.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"String Searching":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom noted the locale dependence.</li>
      <li>PBrett noted collation dependence.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that precise requirements are needed and that basic
          element searching is present.</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested this might be provided by a regular expression
          facility.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Text Boundary Analysis":
    <ul>
      <li>Steve stated there are natural range interfaces for this and that the
          interface is probably clear.</li>
      <li>Hubert asked when a C++ programmer would use this.</li>
      <li>Steve replied that he performs such analysis for reflowing text in
          outgoing email.</li>
      <li>PBrett added that such support was an integral part of a DSP language
          he worked on.</li>
      <li>Steve stated that word wrapping comes up in many scenarios.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Regular Expressions":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom suggested we consider this category if a paper arrives.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that a proposed design would be locale dependent and would
          presumably have to operate on various string types, potentially
          including segmented text data structures.</li>
      <li>PBrett pondered the possibility of a run-time only library with a
          narrow interface that could later be overloaded for new
          extensions.</li>
      <li>Steve stated that this is not an area of his experties but that he
          would be willing to help author a paper if a good design were to
          be proposed.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that there are many SG16 and LEWG related issues to
          consider.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"StringPrep":
    <ul>
      <li>Hubert stated that this feature is related to string normalization
          for interchange purposes such as key lookup.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that the
          <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3454">stringprep RFC</a>
          specifies exclusion of certain characters and expressed a desire to
          better understand what this facility is used for.</li>
      <li>Tom updated the Google Doc to change the consideration column value
          from "N/A" to "No", to add a reference to RFC 3454, and to note that
          this is a string normalization feature.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"IDNA":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom expressed considerable ignorance of this topic.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: "IDNA" stands for
          "Internationalizing Domain Names for Applications" and is covered by
          <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr46">UTS #46</a>. ]</em></li>
      <li>PBrett suggested such support might be needed for standard
          networking.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Universal Time Scale":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom suggested this is not an SG16 concern and could be tackled
          directly by LEWG if motivated.</li>
      <li>Tom updated the Google Doc to change the consideration column value
          from "N/A" to "No; LEWG".</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"Paragraph Layout / Complex Text Layout":
    <ul>
      <li>Review of the ICU <tt>playout.h</tt> header revealed that this is an
          experimental facility.</li>
      <li>Tom updated the Google Doc to change the consideration column value
          from "Not yet" to "No" and added a note about the facility being
          experimental.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"ICU I/O":
    <ul>
      <li>Tom stated this is not an SG16 concern.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tom stated that the next telecon is scheduled for 3/23; the agenda is
      TBD.</li>
</ul>
