<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A round of introductions was held to welcome Fraser as a new
      attendee.</li>
  <li>Planning for Issaquah:
    <ul>
      <li>Tom expressed interest in holding a meeting in Issaquah despite
          neither he nor Peter Brett planning to attend in person.</li>
      <li>Tom reported that Steve agreed to facilitate the in-person aspects
          of the meeting in Issaquah.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested aiming for a half day on Thursday.</li>
      <li>Tom asked who planned to attend in person; three people expressed
          such intent.</li>
      <li>MarkZ reported that he would have a conflict at 3pm every day.</li>
      <li>Discussion ensued regarding the merits of reserving a room vs
          planning for in-person attendees to join via Zoom.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that Zach's recent and upcoming papers may attract more
          interest.</li>
      <li>Zach noted that SG16 tends to attract a few additional attendees
          beyond the regulars.</li>
      <li>Tom stated he would request a room.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p2736r0">P2736R0: Referencing the Unicode Standard</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>Tom summarized the discussion from the
          <a href="https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings#december-14th-2022">2022-12-14 SG16 telecon</a>
          concerning the <tt>__STDC_ISO_10646__</tt> predefined macro.</li>
      <li>Corentin provided an introduction.</li>
      <li>Corentin reported having reviewed the terminology from the Unicode
          Standard to identify wording changes to be made.</li>
      <li>Corentin explained that ISO/IEC 10646 uses "character" in its wording,
          but that the proposed wording uses "abstract character" when
          appropriate.</li>
      <li>Corentin noted that "character" is retained for uses such as
          "character type".</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that the "abstract character" definition from the
          Unicode Standard can be broadly applied and thus should only be used
          when a broad interpretation is actually intended.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied that "abstract character" is relevant when mapping
          between different character sets.</li>
      <li>Corentin indicated that "abstract character" only ended up being used
          in one place.</li>
      <li>Jens asserted there is a need for a term to express equivalence
          between characters.</li>
      <li>Tom agreed and noted that "abstract character" is useful when there
          is more than one possible encoding for the same character;
          as in Unicode normalization forms.</li>
      <li>Hubert acknowledged that "abstract character" would be appropriate
          for the mapping of source code characters to the translation
          character set.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested that is a QoI concern since translation phase 1
          behavior is implementation-defined.</li>
      <li>Hubert agreed use of the term could be avoided there if desired.</li>
      <li>Corentin explained that the C++ standard currently contains two
          normative references to ISO/IEC 10646, one of which is to an
          obsolecent version for a definition of UCS-2; the proposed wording
          replaces references to UCS-2 with a restricted form of UTF-16.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that references to the Unicode Standard are inclusive
          of the annexes; normative references to the annexes are therefore
          removed.</li>
      <li>Corentin reported that many of the changes are mechanical;
          "UCS" was replaced with "Unicode".</li>
      <li>Corentin noted that the control code alias names table was removed
          following discussion on the SG16 mailing list.</li>
      <li>Steve pondered whether notes should be added to the C++ standard that
          explain where to find information in the Unicode Standard.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied that doing so can be useful;
          for example for <tt>NameAliases.txt</tt>.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that "UCS Encoding Form" is more restrictive than
          "Unicode Encoding Form"; the latter isn't limited to the common UTF
          encodings..</li>
      <li>Mark asked if that terminology should not then be changed.</li>
      <li>Hubert replied that it might be necessary to add constraints or to
          find another way to identify the relevant encodings.</li>
      <li>Mark suggested that the first heading in Table 1 in [lex.charset]
          could be changed to "abstract character".</li>
      <li>Jens objected and explained that the first column lists code points
          and the second column lists names; these are concrete character
          references.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied that he had not felt a need to change the use of
          "character" in that table heading.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that the change to remove the control code alias table
          changes the specification with regard to allowances for the "BELL"
          and "ALERT" names.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied that wording was added to restrict alias names to
          those that are specified as
          "control", "correction", and "alternate".</li>
      <li>Jens noted that the code page chart appears to list "BELL" as a
          control name, but in a confusing way that is inconsistent with the
          names in <tt>NameAliases.txt</tt>.</li>
      <li><em>[ Editor's note: The discussion of "BELL" and "ALERT" centers
          around how the Unicode Standard presents the alias names for U+0007.
          The
          <a href="https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf">C0 Controls and Basic Latin PDF</a>
          displays as follows.
          <blockquote class="quote">
<pre>0007  &lt;control&gt;
             = BELL</pre>

          <a href="https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/NameAliases.txt"><tt>NameAliases.txt</tt></a>
          is more clear in its intent:
          <blockquote class="quote">
<pre># Note that no formal name alias for the ISO 6429 "BELL" is
# provided for U+0007, because of the existing name collision
# with U+1F514 BELL.

0007;ALERT;control
0007;BEL;abbreviation</pre>
          </blockquote>
          ]</em></li>
      <li>Tom summarized the concern; implementors might look at the code page
          charts and become confused or implement something other than what is
          intended.</li>
      <li>Corentiin replied with doubts that implementors would base their
          implementations on the code page charts.</li>
      <li>Zach asked if the intent can be made more explicit by reintroducing a
          note to direct readers to <tt>NameAliases.txt</tt>.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that a note would be helpful and that be believes the
          existing table was originally built from content in
          <tt>NameAliases.txt</tt>.</li>
      <li>Steve suggested amending the proposed
          "control, correction, or alternate" wording to add
          "as specified in <tt>NameAliases.txt</tt>".</li>
      <li>Jens expressed concern about duplicating content from the Unicode
          Standard.</li>
      <li>Zach suggested retaining the prior
          "These names are derived from the Unicode Character Database's
          <tt>NameAliases.txt</tt>" wording but with "derived" removed.</li>
      <li>Corentin agreed to make a change.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that references to the Unicode Standard should have
          "the" capitalized.</li>
      <li>Tom expressed a preference in favor of "Unicode code point" over
          "Unicode scalar value" with the latter reserved for use in
          expressing requirements.</li>
      <li>Zach expressed indifference and noted that UCD properties won't be
          present for surrogate code points.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that use of "Unicode scalar value" has the advantage
          of avoiding the question of whether non-scalar values need to be
          considered in the given context.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that "Unicode scalar value" implies a precondition that,
          if violated, could lead to undefined behavior.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested that references to chapters of the Unicode Standard
          should use both numbers and names for resiliency against changes.</li>
      <li>Corentin explained that references to UCS-2 were replaced with
          references to UTF-16 with additional restrictions to limit encoded
          characters to those in the BMP.</li>
      <li>Fraser replied that there is a semantic difference since UCS-2 allowed
          encoding surrogate code points.</li>
      <li>Corentin responded that the previous wording was not clear how such
          code points were to be handled.</li>
      <li>Hubert pointed out that, in the proposed wording for the
          <tt>codecvt</tt> facets, the first bullet describes the artifacts
          produced by an encoding where as the second bullet names an
          encoding.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that both bullets should be written such that they can be
          easily read as specifying encodings.</li>
      <li>Jens suggested retaining UCS-2 teminology by adding a definition of
          it that specifies it as a restricted form of UTF-16.</li>
      <li>Zach expressed a preference for the currently proposed wording with
          the category error corrected.</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested that the wording state that the facet only maps
          from that code point range and nothing else.</li>
      <li>Tom observed that, if the UTF-8 text has characters that map outside
          the BMP, the wording doesn't say what happens.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that we need to make it clear that just converting to
          UTF-16 isn't acceptible.</li>
      <li>Corentin explained that he did not remove the UAX #31 reference since
          Steve is working on related changes.</li>
      <li>Corentin expressed uncertainty whether a separate UAX #31 reference
          is needed.</li>
      <li>Corentin observed that some unintended <tt>tcode</tt> LaTeX markup
          appears in one of the bibliography entries proposed for removal.</li>
      <li>Zach returned discussion to the <tt>__STDC_ISO_10646__</tt> predefined
          macro, noted that it is inherited from C, and opined that there is
          nothing to be done for it.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that the wording essentially states that <tt>wchar_t</tt>
          must be at least 21 bits for the macro to be defined.</li>
      <li>Hubert observed that the proposed change loses the requirement that
          storing a wide character stores a value that matches that character's
          Unicode scalar value.</li>
      <li>Hubert explained that this behavior is the design flaw that makes it
          not possible for a compiler to predefine this macro; the value held
          in an object of type <tt>wchar_t</tt> has a locale dependent
          interpretation.</li>
      <li>Zach suggested that restricting the implication to the encoding of
          wide character literals might be an improvement.</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested this might be a matter worth discussing in SG22.</li>
      <li>Zach asked if the wording could just defer to the C standard.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that we can do so for library wording, but not for core
          wording.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that we could match the wording in the C standard.</li>
      <li>Steve noted a misspelling of 10646 in the first paragraph of the
          Motivation section: "10446".</li>

<h2>Meeting summary:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A round of introductions was conducted for Nathan; though he had attended
      previous meetings, we had never formally introduced ourselves.</li>
  <li>Planning for NOT Issaquah.
    <ul>
      <li>Tom explained that, due to competing priorities and a shortage of
          conference rooms, the only time slot available was for an evening
          session and, per previous discussion, an evening session time slot
          would be challenging for remote attendees; as a result, SG16 will
          not host an in-person meeting, but Tom is open to hosting another
          telecon next week before Issaquah to continue paper review.</li>
      <li>Zach agreed with meeting next week, but argued that an in-person
          meeting in Issaquah should still be held.</li>
      <li>PBrett opined that there would be few attendees.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that a number of people that will have opinions on
          his papers will be present in Issaquah.</li>
      <li>Corentin asserted we should plan to meet in Varna.</li>
      <li>PBrett stated that Zach's
          <a href="https://wg21.link/p2728r0">P2728R0: Unicode in the Library, Part 1: UTF Transcoding</a>
          and
          <a href="https://wg21.link/p2729r0">P2729R0: Unicode in the Library, Part 2: Normalization</a>
          require SG16 review from an interface perspective.</li>
      <li>Tom agreed with Peter.</li>
      <li>Steve suggested that it would be useful to get early feedback from
          LEWG for Zach's papers.</li>
      <li>Steve noted that we don't want to spend months in review and then
          have LEWG question the design later.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that we should ensure people are aware that these
          papers target C++26 and that time slots will be available in Varna
          and later meetings.</li>
      <li>Steve agreed that we should not host an official SG16 meeting in
          Issaquah.</li>
      <li>Tom stated that we will proceed with a telecon next week and no
          meeting in Issaquah.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://wg21.link/p2736r0">P2736R0: Referencing the Unicode Standard</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>Corentin explained the changes made, as suggested by Jens, to provide
          a definition for UCS-2 as needed for <tt>std::codecvt_utf8</tt> and
          <tt>std::codecvt_utf16</tt>.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that the UCS-2 definition is specified in terms of
          scalar values so as to exclude lone surrogates.</li>
      <li>Corentin noted that the previous wording did not address how lone
          surrogates were to be handled.</li>
      <li>Hubert suggested moving where "only" appears in the UCS-2
          wording.</li>
      <li>Corentin reported that various grammar and spelling issues pointed
          out by Jens were corrected.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that the prior discussion of the
          <tt>__STDC_ISO_10646__</tt> predefined macro was inconclusive.</li>
      <li>Hubert recalled a suggestion to treat this macro the same as
          <tt>__STDC_VERSION__</tt>.</li>
      <li>Fraser asked if <tt>__STDC_ISO_10646__</tt> could be removed from the
          C++ standard and noted that implementations could still define it
          since it is a reserved identifier.</li>
      <li>Corentin expressed reluctance to doing so as part of this paper since
          this paper is not intended to make design changes.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that he plans to work with SG22 and WG14 regarding the
          intended use of the macro.</li>
      <li>Corentin asserted that a minimal change suffices for now to remove the
          reliance on ISO/IEC 10646.</li>
      <li>Hubert replied that the proposed change isn't the minimal solution
          since it diverges from the C standard.</li>
      <li>Hubert clarified that the suggestion wasn't to reference the C
          standard, but rather to leave the definition rather meaningless so
          that implementors lean on C for meaning.</li>
      <li>Corentin asked if the suggestion was to just make the macro
          implemenation-defined.</li>
      <li>Tom replied that he thought that was what Fraser had suggested.</li>
      <li>Fraser confirmed.</li>
      <li>Jens asserted that the wording should preserve the condition that the
          macro, if defined, has a value with a particular syntactical
          form.</li>

      <li>Hubert noted some existing occurrences of "Unicode encoding" in the
          wording for [lex.string.escaped].</li>
      <li>Corentin reported that he did not see a reason to update that
          wording.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that the relevant encodings should be restricted to
          UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 because the formal definition of
          "Unicode encoding" is too inclusive.</li>
      <li>Discussion ensued regarding encoding form vs encoding scheme and the
          observation that, for <tt>std::format</tt> with a wide format string,
          <tt>wchar_t</tt> elements correspond to an encoding form.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked if the wording can just state
          "UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32".</li>
      <li>Corentin agreed to make that change.</li>
      <li>Jens lamented the loss of wording in [lex.name] regarding what

      <li>Jens asserted a note should be retained to direct readers to their

      <li>Corentin opined that a note isn't needed since the terms are in a
          normative reference.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that such a note is present for other properties such as
          <tt>Grapheme_Extend</tt>.</li>
      <li>Corentin stated that he is fine with retaining a note.</li>
      <li>PBrett asked about following the existing pattern in
          [format.string.escaped] for the <tt>General_Category</tt> and
          <tt>Grapheme_Extend</tt> properties where it is stated
          "as described by table 12 of UAX #44".</li>
      <li>Zack expressed concern about the stability of text files.</li>
      <li>Tom suggested more generic wording like

          at the telecon.

      <li>Corentin provided an introduction:
        <ul>
          <li>The wording substitutes "Unicode scalar value" for "character"
              in many places, but retains the latter in some contexts.</li>
          <li>This removes the "translation character set" indirection.</li>
          <li>The changes were mechanically applied.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>PBrett expressed support for the improved specificity.</li>
      <li>Corentin began reviewing the wording changes.</li>
      <li>Tom noted that Jens had previously requested an overview of the final
          state we are driving towards with these kinds of changes.</li>
      <li>Corentin replied that the motivation section addresses some of those
          concerns.</li>
      <li>Jens stated that he finds the proposed wording confusing since
          "character" ends up getting mixed in with Unicode terminology.</li>
      <li>Corentin explained that he has concerns about introducing a lot of
          churn that doesn't help to improve clarity.</li>
      <li>Fraser stated that additional specificity is probably needed to
          clarify which characters constitute new-line and whitespace.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that, with the exception of new-line, that characters are
          specified using Unicode code points.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that
          <a href="https://wg21.link/p2348">P2348 (Whitespaces Wording Revamp)</a>
          is relevant.</li>
      <li>Corentin explained that he intentionally did not modify the
          specification of whitespace in this paper.</li>
      <li>Corentin expressed a desire for agreement on the replacement of
          "elements of the translation character set".</li>
      <li>PBrett noticed an editorial issue in [lex.charset] for
          <em>n-char</em>; the updated wording retains "set" from the intended
          substitution of "Unicode code point" for "member of the translation
          character set".</li>
      <li>Jens observed that a change in [lex.phases] to substitute
          "Unicode scalar value" for
          ".. elements of the translation character set" retains a reference to
          [lex.charset] that no longer makes sense.</li>
      <li>Jens opined that the note in [lex.charset] that describes the
          difference between "code points" and "scalar values" should be
          retained.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that the location of that note is a little odd since it
          doesn't encapsulate the notion of "abstract character".</li>
      <li>Hubert observed that the updates to [lex.phases]p3 only updated one of
          the two uses of "space character".</li>
      <li>Corentin asked for opinions regarding a footnote in [lex.name] that
          discusses representation of characters outside the basic character set
          in external identifiers.</li>
      <li>Hubert stated that the footnote could use some updates.</li>
      <li>Tom opined that the footnote should just be removed.</li>
      <li>Jens noted that
          <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/implimits#2.6">[implimits]p(2.6)</a>
          does specify a minimum limit for the number of significant characters
          in an external identifier.</li>
      <li>PBrett stated that the the uses of "character" in that annex need to
          be addressed.</li>
      <li>Corentin asked if CWG would be content with the removal of that
          footnote.</li>
      <li>Jens replied that he does not know but that he personally does not see
          value in retaining it; the note probably serviced its value 20 some
          years ago.</li>
      <li>Jens observed that "characters" would have to be interpreted as code
          points for the purposes of the external identifier limit.</li>
      <li>Tom noted the implication that, if UTF-8 was used for the encoding of
          external identifiers, a worst case limit must be assumed such that a
          limit of 1024 code points implies a limit of 4096 code units.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tom reported that SG16 will meet in one week, on 2023-02-01 in order to
      squeeze in one more review of P2749R0 before the WG21 meeting in
      Issaquah.</li>
